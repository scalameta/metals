We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.6.2. The release is mostly
focused on adding bugfixes for the most recent v0.6.1 release, but does include
several major improvements. This will most likely be the last release before the
v0.7.0 one.


Side note, as of this release we also dropped the `Work in progress` label,
since Metals already includes most major features of LSP and behaved pretty
stable for past few months.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) along with contributors from the
community.

In this release we merged <TODO> PRs and closed <TODO> issues, full details:
<TODO>

## TL;DR

- fallback to `show usages` from `Goto definition` if reference is definition
  itself
- support for Scala 2.13
- dropping all Scala versions but 2.11.12, 2.12.7, 2.12.8 and 2.13.0
- fixes for importing builds in Gradle, Mill and sbt
- Metals now works with JDK 11
- miscellaneous fixes

## Fallback to `show usages` from `Goto definition`

Thanks to an awesome contribution from @tanishiking we are now able to provide
you with information about usages if 'Goto definition' was used on the
definition itself.

## Support for Scala 2.13

A lot of work was done by @gabro to make Metals compatible with Scala 2.13. More
details about it can be seen in
[his PR](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/763).

## Dropping older Scala versions

Starting from the next version we are dropping all versions but `2.11.12`,
`2.12.7`, `2.12.8` and `2.13.0` while deprecating `2.11.12` and `2.12.7`. By
deprecating `2.11.12` we want to push users to upgrade if they can as it is hard
for Metals to support 2.11 with the same levels of features as more recent
versions. This come up when making Metals compatible with Scala 2.13 and it
turns out it is getting very difficult for us to support multiple Scala
versions. It must be noted that we're not dropping `2.11.12` anytime soon and
even when we will, 2.11 users will always be able to use an older version of
Metals.

## Metals now works with JDK 11

Thanks to the joint effort by @olafurpg and @er1c Metals now works with JDK 11!
The effort included fixing several JDK 11 issues and some awesome improvements
to the indexing itself. <TODO>

## Fixes for auto importing builds

- digest only `.sbt` files at workspace level for sbt projects (thanks
  @wojciechUrbanski!)
- fix SemanticDB plugin path on Windows for Gradle workspaces
- update default Mill version to 0.4.1 to fix an issue with classpath not
  containing Scala library
- Metals now pick up the version from `.mill-version` for the `millw` script

## Miscellaneous fixes

- fix off-by-one for parameter hints
- make sure we add an autoimport in the correct line in case of brackets
- parsing no longer fails when `val _ = ()` is the only thing in the block
- nested objects are now imported correctly in case of deeper nesting
- fix concurrent modification in text document cache (thanks @chikei!)
