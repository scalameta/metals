Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Scala 2.12.12 support
- Reset notifications popup

## Reset notifications popup

Previously, when either a build tool was chosen for a workspace or the build
import notification was dismissed the only way to revert that choice was to
delete the `.metals` directory. In this release we added two different ways to
reset it:

- via a new button available in the doctor (Visual Studio Code):

- using a new command `metals.reset-choice` (other editors):

## Miscellaneous improvements

- Named parameters completions fixed to work in cases where the method was
  defined later in the class.
- Add option to not add the Bloop plugin in Gradle builds. This might be useful
  if you already define Bloop plugin in your workspace, otherwise it's not
  recommended.
- Find all templates from the giter8 wiki page for the New Project Provider
