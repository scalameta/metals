We're happy to announce the release of Metals v0.11.11, which brings in a couple
of new features and improvements as well as stability fixes. Further releases
and possibly 1.0.0 release will focus on providing a better stable development
environment.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs and
Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/)
and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com) with the help from
[Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## Support for Scala 3.2.2

Release notes from
[https://www.scala-lang.org/news/3.2.2](https://www.scala-lang.org/news/3.2.2)

This version not only fixes bugs but also brings two new flags:

- `-Vrepl-max-print-characters` allows you to configure how many characters can
  be printed in the REPL before truncating the output. The default limit was
  also raised from 1,000 to 50,000 characters.

- `-Ylightweight-lazy-vals` enables new lazy vals implementation. It can be much
  more performant, especially in cases of parallel access. However, it can cause
  problems when used inside of GraalVM native image. We will make the new
  implementation the default one as soon as we fix those problems.

## Introduce Support for Semantic Tokens

Semantic tokens is a newer addition to the language server protocol that enables
editors to provide syntax highlighting based on the knowledge provided by the
language server. Each symbol within the Scala file should now have a more
meaningful color dependent on whether it's a class, field, operator, etc.

This feature is now available in Metals thanks to the main work done by
[ShintaroSasaki](https://github.com/ShintaroSasaki) during last year's Google
summer of code and some later additional effort by other Metals contributors
mainly [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk). Since this feature would
impact all the users in every file they open, we decided to put it first behind
an additional user setting `metals.enableSemanticHighlighting`, which needs to
be set to true. Later depending on your editor, you might also need to enable it
in some other places.

For example in VS Code you also need to set
`editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` to `true`. So the settings json files
would look like this:

```json
...
  "metals.enableSemanticHighlighting": true,
  "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true,
...
```

You can also modify your theme colors and styles for some particular types of
symbols. For example:

```json
  "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[Adapta Nokto]": {
      "rules": {
        "variable": "#c95252",
        "*.readonly": "#8d91b8",
        "*.deprecated": {
          "strikethrough": true
        }
      }
    }
  },
```

will make vars red and values light blue while also crossing out any deprecated
methods or classes.

For setting up semantic tokens in editors other than VS Code please consult the
relevant documentation.

## New inline value code action

Inline value is a new code action contributed by
[kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) that allows users to inline the
right hand side of any value if the definition of that value is located within
the same file. This works in two ways:

- if inlining at a reference we will only replace the current value reference

![replace-one](https://i.imgur.com/yLuM079.gif)

- if inlining at the definition we will try to replace all the references and
  remove the definition if the definition cannot be accessed from outside the
  current file

![replace-all](https://i.imgur.com/LdlSQsB.gif)

## Expanded workspace symbol search to include fields

Previously, when searching the workspace Metals would only look for classes,
trait, interfaces, enums and objects. If you wanted to search for a particularly
named method you would need to use normal text search, which would be much less
convenient. This release adds the ability to also search for method, types or
values within the workspace. This will not work for dependencies in order to not
increase indexes used by Metals too much.

Another great contribution from [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek)!

## Allow users to use older Scala versions

To provide support for a particular Scala version Metals needs to release a
separate version for each of them, which causes a strain on CI infrastructure.
Because of that previously we would stop supporting some older Scala versions.
However, now instead of entirely dropping support for older versions, we will
only freeze the amount of features and not fix any new bugs for any of those
older versions.

We will still recommend updating to the newest possible binary compatible
version of the Scala version you are using, but in case it's not possible for
you it should be safe to use Metals with those older versions.

In this release we removed Scala 3.0.0, 2.13.1, 2.13.2, 2.12.9, 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.
You can still use them, but some of the newest features will not be available
for them including inline and semantic tokens.

## Improve match-case completions in Scala 2

Last release introduced some improvements for completions in pattern matching in
Scala 3. This release brings them also to Scala 2 including:

- pattern only completions, i.e. completions in:

```scala
Option(1) match {
  case No@@
  case _: So@@
```

- completions like:

```scala
case class Foo(a: Int, b: Int)
List(Foo(1,2)).map{ case F@@ }
// turns into
List(Foo(1,2)).map{ case Foo(a,b) => }
```

- exhaustive match completions in anonymous functions:

```scala
List(Option(1)).map { case@@ }
// turns into
List(Option(1)).map {
  case Some(value) =>
  case None =>
}
```

In all the examples `@@` denotes the position of the cursor.

This cool improvement was added by [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk).

## Fallback to symbol search for code navigation

Metals uses both global semanticdb indexes as well as the compiler itself to
find the definition of any symbol. However, whenever your workspace had problems
with compilation both those methods could have failed to actually find that
definition. Instead of giving up, since Metals indexes all the names of types,
methods etc. we will try to find the symbol by name within the user's workspace.

This heuristic might sometimes offer false positives, but it's much more useful
than being left with no definition location at all. We will continue to improve
those heuristics to make sure that the number of false positives is reduced.

## Automatically add details to github issue

Thanks to [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) whenever users open an
issue from the Metals tree view or via the `open-new-github-issue` command, the
issue will have all the details filled out automatically. This should reduce the
amount of information that the users need to type manually and make it much more
efficient to submit new issues.
