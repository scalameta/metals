We are happy to announce the release of Metals v0.9.0, codename "Lithium", which
main focus is introducing support for Scala 3 starting with versions 0.23.0 and
0.24.0-RC1. We also added support for Scala 2.13.2 and a number of other useful
improvements.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Scala 2.13.2 and basic Scala 3 support
- Improvements to the Bloop integration
- Automatically add '+' on newline when inside a string
- New Code action: "Import all missing symbols"

## Basic Scala 3 support

For a couple of the last months we have been working on making Metals work with
the Dotty compiler, which will become the new Scala 3. This effort included
contributions to Metals, Bloop as well as to Dotty. Thanks to the great help
from the Dotty compiler team, we now have an option to generate semanticDB files
used for our internal indexes, which allowed some features to work without any
changes to the core code. It is also important to mention that without
[jvican](https://github.com/jvican) and his Bloop project, which already
supports Scala 3, all this would have taken a much longer time.

That said, there are some issues that are lacking in the Scala 3 support that
are available for 2.x versions. Most notably, we are still missing all of the
more advanced completions, filtering and sorting of completion items or auto
imports. There are also some possible issues connected to optional braces and
top level methods features. In the upcoming months we are planning to address
most of these issues and implement the lacking features.

You can find missing features in the
[feature requests repository](https://github.com/scalameta/metals-feature-requests/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ascala3)
and currently known bugs in the
[main Metals repo.](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Scala+3%22)

The first supported versions will be `0.23.0` and `0.24.0-RC1`, which are the
latest stable and the latest release candidate respectably. We plan to always
support the latest stable and release candidate until there is a more stable
release cycle for Scala 3.

Please do report any issues you encounter, especially connected to some new
Scala 3 features, which will be an immense help to the team.

## Improvements related to Bloop/Metals integration

There have been multiple reported issues in the last weeks about hanging
compilation, which can make the Metals workspace hard to use. Our top priority
has been figuring out all the possible issues both in Metals as well as in
Bloop. Thanks to some fixes done by [jvican](https://github.com/jvican), and
some work on the Metals side on the Bloop integration we're hopeful that some of
the issues are becoming less frequent. These fixes are included in this release.

We also reworked the Metals tree view to highlight some commands that a user can
use to fix their workspace as well as added two new commands:

- `Clean compile workspace` - clean compile the whole workspace - might be
  needed in case of broken compiler caches.
- `Restart Bloop server` - restart the Bloop build server, which should help
  with the cases where compilation would hang.

Even if those commands help, do not hesitate to report any issues. We are also
monitoring the situation ourselves and investigating all problems encountered.

## Automatically add '+' on newline inside a string

The Metals team was recently joined by [mlachkar](https://github.com/mlachkar),
an engineer from the Scala Center, who already contributed a number of features
and bug fixes to the project. Thanks to her, we can now easily enter a newline
inside a single line string and that string will be correctly split with an
additional `+`.

## Code action to import all missing symbols

Previously, it was only available to import one symbol at a time in case of
missing imports. Thanks to [colineto](https://github.com/colineto) we now have
the ability to import everything in bulk for every unambiguous import available.
Unambiguous in this case meaning that there is only one possible import to
choose from.

## Miscellaneous improvements

- Added an option to ignore .scalafmt.conf creation message.
- Fixed hanging while debugging if workspace had errors.
- Fixed issue with folding in non 2.12.11 workspaces.
- Turn off "Go to parent" code lenses by default due to performance problems in
  large workspaces.
- Fixed false parsing errors in 2.13.x workspaces.
- Added date string to metals logs.
- Fixed issue with additional src directories being created automatically.
- Fixed "Go to implementation" to work with local aliases.
- Fixed auto-import issue in package objects.

## Contributors

Big thanks to everybody who contributed to this release! We had a lot of new
contributors doing some really exemplary work.
