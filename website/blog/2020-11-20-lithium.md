title: Metals v0.9.6 - Lithium

We're happy to announce the release of Metals v0.9.6, which mostly concentrates
on adding support for the newly released Scala 2.13.4, but also adds some
improvements for already existing features.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Scala 2.13.4 support.
- Show implicit conversions and classes.
- Navigating stacktrace in debug console.
- New troubleshooting page.

## Show implicit conversions and classes

Last
[release](/metals/blog/2020/11/10/lithium#show-implicits-and-type-decorations)
introduced the option to display additional data inferred from the code to a
user. Starting with this release it's also possible to show implicit conversions
and classes, which can be enabled by the additional
`showImplicitConversionsAndClasses` setting. Moreover, Visual Studio Code
extension has 3 new commands to toggle all these new options, which enables
users to quickly peek at the additional information about their code and then
turn it back off. All these commands can be bound to a shortcut to further
improve the user experience.

![implicits](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2020-11-20-lithium/k6GRgue.gif?raw=true)

Any editor that allows for quickly changing these settings will also benefit
from this change, as the file's decorations are refreshed instantly upon
changing any of those settings.

## Navigating stacktrace

Previously, it was possible to navigate a stacktrace using the
`Analyze stacktrace` command which was added in the
[v0.9.4](/metals/blog/2020/09/21/lithium#analyze-stacktrace-command) release. It
turns out, we can reuse the same mechanism to show file links in the
`Debug Console` in Visual Studio code:

![navigate-stacktrace](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2020-11-20-lithium/qeitymN.gif?raw=true)

This was achieved by adding additional information to the output already sent to
the editor, so this additional file links should also be reused by any other DAP
clients.

## Troubleshooting

As an addition to these new features, we've also recently added a new
[troubleshooting page](/metals/docs/troubleshooting/faq) that should answer the
most basic questions you can have. As the page is fairly new we would appreciate
any help in improving it so let us know if you feel anything is missing.

## Miscellaneous

- Fix continuous compilation when opening tree view in sbt BSP
- Add 0.27.0-RC1 back to supported versions
