We're happy to announce the release of Metals v0.11.9, which brings some of the
final missing features in Scala 3 and greatly improves its performance. We also
had quite a number of contributions in this release and I wanted to thank all
the new contributors for their great work!

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs and
Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/)
and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com) with the help from
[Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## Adjust mismatched type

Until recently it was only possible to add the type to a definition that didn't
have it defined. However, it's also quite common for users to change the
returned type of the body of a function and in that case any adjustments had to
be made manually. Now, whenever the compiler shows type mismatch error Metals
should be able to adjust the type for you automatically.

As this feature is quite new and might still require some tinkering, please
report any issues you find.

## Ammonite completions for Scala 3

Until recently Metals was only offering `$file` completions for Scala 2, but
thanks to [zmerr](https://github.com/zmerr) it's also possible to get them in
Scala 3.

For more details take a look at the previous
[announcement](https://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2020/07/01/lithium/#ammonite-support)

## Better Scala CLI support

[ScalaCLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) is a tool developed by VirtusLab in
an effort to create a simple experience of using Scala for all its users. It has
a lot of nice features, but one of the main ones is
[the possibility to use it in scripts](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/guides/scripts).
Thanks to [alexarchambault](https://github.com/alexarchambault), who is also
leading the effort on ScalaCLI, Metals now supports ScalaCLI scripts along with
the Ammonite ones.

![scala-cli](https://i.imgur.com/ghR1Src.gif)

Whenever, Metals will be opened on a file with `*.sc` extension (but not
`*.worksheet.sc`), users will be prompted to choose which tool they want to use
for the script.

Similar to Ammonite, support for it can also be turned on manually with
`Metals: Start Scala CLI BSP server` and stopped with
`Metals: Stop Scala CLI BSP server`. These commands can be used for more fine
grained control when to turn on or of scripting support. This is especially
useful since ScalaCLI supports will run an additional BSP server running
underneath and that can take up some additional resources.

If the script is in a dedicated folder, by default we will treat all the scripts
and scala files in that directory as ones that can be used together. So you
would be able to import method and classes from those files. However, if the
script is contained within a directory that also contains other sources, that
script will be treated as a standalone one in order to avoid flaky compilation
errors coming from normal files in the workspace.

## [Scala 3] Auto import symbols in string interpolation

Previously, the only suggestions for string interpolations were coming from the
currently available symbols in scope. This meant that if you wanted to import
something from another package, you would need to do it manually.

This problem is now resolved. Users can easily get such symbols automatically
imported, which creates a seamless more workflow.

![auto-import](https://i.imgur.com/COKtciq.gif)

These completions will also allow you to automatically import extension methods.

The feature is already available for Scala 2.

## [Scala 3] Add autofill named arguments completion

Thanks to great work by [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk) Scala 3
completions will also show an `autofill all` completion item, which will try to
fill in all the arguments of the current method using the symbol in scope or
with `???` if no symbols match. Users can later tabulate over the different
proposal to adjust them.

![auto-fill](https://i.imgur.com/tZTKnSw.gif)

The feature was already available for Scala 2.

## [Scala 3] Improved performance

We've noticed that previous versions of Metals could cause CPU spikes for anyone
using Scala 3. To address this, we managed to include a couple performance
improvements in this release. This will improve several editor features such as
hover, completions, document highlight, and some code actions.

For more details, see the pull requests.

- [Don't run InteractiveDriver.run if the content didn't "change" by tanishiking · Pull Request #4225 · scalameta/metals](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/4225)
- [fix: \[Scala3\] Don't compute docs on textDocument/completion by tanishiking · Pull Request #4396 · scalameta/metals](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/4396)

Thanks to [tanishiking](https://github.com/tanishiking)) for investigation and
his great fixes.

## Make documentHighlight more reliable

Document highlight allows users to see all occurrences of the symbol currently
under the cursor in a single file. This was one of the first
[features](https://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2019/04/12/mercury#document-highlight)
developed by me for Metals and previously it would only work in a fully compiled
workspace. This means that if users have errors, some of the occurrences might
not be highlighted.

Since the feature only works within a single file, this was a perfect candidate
for turning into a more interactive feature, which would use the Scala
presentation compiler already used in such features as hovers or completions.
Thanks to this change document highlight should work even if your code doesn't
compile.

![document-highlight](https://i.imgur.com/0uhc9P5.gif)

This should also make it easier for us to fix any issue that might pop up and it
has already improved support for locally defined classes.

## [Scala 3] Add completions for case and match

Metals provides additional completions whenever users write match clauses to
automatically fill either a single case with one of the possible subtypes or an
exhaustive completion with all of them. This was previously not available for
Scala 3, but thanks to ([jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk)) users can now
benefit from this feature in their Scala 3 codebases.

![exhaustive](https://i.imgur.com/6wynpRq.gif)

The Scala 3 version will additionally work with the Scala enums as well as offer
completions for simple cases with one possible type, which might be useful to
access values inside it. Moreover, exhaustive completions will also be offered
within partial function, for example in a `.map{}`.

## Extract Method code action

Another great feature contributed by [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk)
is the possibility to extract arbitrary parts of code into a separate function.
It will also add any values unavailable in the selected scope as parameters in
the new function.

![extract-method](https://i.imgur.com/VMXLKPg.gif)

The code action will currently not turn any methods or classes into parameters
even if they is not available in the scope into which the code is being
extracted.

## [Scala 2] Add Completions for ivy Imports in Ammonite scripts and worksheets

Both in worksheets and in ammonite scripts you can add dependencies using
imports such as:

```scala
import $$ivy.`io.circe::circe-core:0.14.2`
```

which will bring in the `circe-core` dependency. Starting in this version it
will be possible to auto complete group ids, artifact names and their versions.

![import-dep](https://i.imgur.com/TWgIIVp.gif)

Thanks to [LaurenceWarne](https://github.com/LaurenceWarne) for the great
feature!

We are also working on enabling this feature in Mill, sbt, ScalaCLI and later
for Scala 3.

## Call hierarchy

This release brings about
[call hierarchy support](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#textDocument_prepareCallHierarchy),
which is an LSP feature that enables users to see which method are invoked in a
current method or which methods invoke the current one.

![call-hierarchy-dep](https://i.imgur.com/1lTYFmu.gif)

This non trivial feature was brought to you by
[riiswa](https://github.com/riiswa), thanks for the great work!

A current limitation is that it will only work for methods within the workspace.

## [Scala 3] Enable fewer braces for Scala 3 nightly versions

Fewer braces is an experimental Scala 3 feature that enables users to drop
braces in more places than the default, for example in function invocations.
Previously, Metals would show it as error, but since this version fewer braces
option will be recognized by default for the Scala 3 nightly versions.

Read more about fewer braces
[here](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/experimental/fewer-braces.html).

More work is required to enable auto formatting with this option and will be
worked on in the near future.
