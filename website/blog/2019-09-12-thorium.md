We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.7.5 - codename "Thorium" 🎉
The release includes couple of bug fixes for 0.7.2, which were present in some
rare scenarios. We also added a new experimental feature, which we would be
happy to get feedback about.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
along with contributors from the community.

In this release we merged 12 PRs and closed 6 issues, full details:

## TL;DR

Check out the website and give Metals a try: https://scalameta.org/metals/

- add auto-fill option to case classes
- deduce values for named parameters completions
- multiple fixes after adding support for Scala 2.12.9
- fixes for automatic addition of `|` in multiline strings

## Add auto-fill option to case classes

Whenever we invoke a method and try completions inside the brackets there is an
additional option to allow Metals to deduce what should be filled for each
parameter.

This algorithm checks if there exists a value in scope with the same type as the
parameters' and then works according to the rules below:

```
1. If there is only one candidate, use it.
2. If there is more than one, give user an alternative to choose one of them.
3. Otherwise use use "???".
```

This feature also uses the snippets syntax to allow to quickly go over the
auto-filled parameters and choose or replace the auto-filled values.

## Deduce values for named parameters completions

Leveraging the work that went into the previous feature, we were also able to
provide additional support for concrete values in named parameter completions.

We generate completion item for each value that fits the type of the parameter.

## Multiple fixes after adding support for Scala 2.12.9

After updating Metals to work with Scala 2.12.9 it turned out that completions
and hover didn't work correctly and due to the presentation compiler crashing in
the following scenarios:

- whenever an older version of SemanticDB plugin was used as was the case with
  Mill
- when using Scala 2.12.8 without SemanticDB plugin

Both issues have now been fixed and additionally we updated the default Mill
version to 0.5.1, which works correctly with Scala 2.12.9.

## Fixes for automatic addition of `|` in multiline strings

We now make sure that `stripMargin` exists when adding `|` automatically in
multiline strings. This could cause issues in some scenarios, where multiline
string contained `|`, but it was not only used for formatting.

Additionally, we fixed the feature to also work in interpolated strings, which
was missing in the previous release.
