title: Metals v0.6.1 - Radium
---

We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.6.1, codename "Radium" ðŸŽ‰
The release mostly focused on adding support for the build tools Gradle, Maven
and Mill.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) along with contributors from the
community.

In this release we merged 24 PRs and closed 6 issues, full details:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/7?closed=1.

## TL;DR

- automatic "import build" for Gradle, Maven and Mill
- upgraded to Bloop v1.3.2
- better handling of requests that access the presentation compiler
- code completions on keywords
- VS Code doesn't compile projects until it is focused
- Metals is now a default server in the Sublime LSP package

Check out the website and give Metals a try: https://scalameta.org/metals/

## Bloop upgrade

Metals now depends on Bloop v1.3.2 instead of v1.2.5. The v1.3 release of Bloop
has a ton of nice improvements that benefit Metals users. For full details, see
the
[Bloop v1.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/tag/v1.3.0).

## Automatic "import build" for Gradle, Maven and Mill

Now, it's possible to use Metals with the build tools Gradle, Maven and Mill!
Importing a build with Gradle, Maven and Mill now works the same way it works
for sbt.

For more details, see the corresponding documentation for each build tool:

- [Overview](http://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/overview.html)
- [Gradle](http://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/gradle.html)
- [Maven](http://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/maven.html)
- [Mill](http://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/mill.html)

## More reliable shutdown

An issue where the Metals process could continue running even after closing the
editor has now been fixed.

## Completions freeze less

An issue where Metals could get stuck in an infinite loop using 100% CPU while
responding to completions has now been fixed.

## Keyword completions

Previously, Metals did not complete keywords like `import`, `new`, `lazy val` or
`trait`. Language keywords are now included in the auto-completions in most
cases.

```scala
object Main {
    // Before
    impo<COMPLETE>
    // After
    import
}
```

Keywords are suggested based on the context (e.g. you won't see throw suggested
if the cursor is not inside a declaration)

The only keywords that are not completed are: `extends`, `finally`, `with`,
`forSome`, `catch` and `finally`.

## VS Code doesn't compile projects until it is focused

Previously, Metals would trigger compilation in the background even if the VS
Code window was not focused. For example, switching git branches in a separate
terminal window would still trigger compilation in Metals. Now, Metals waits
until the VS Code window is focused to trigger compilation.

This feature is implemented as a LSP extension and is currently only supported
by VS Code. For details on how to implement this extension for another editor,
see the
[documentation on integrating a new text editor](http://scalameta.org/metals/docs/integrations/new-editor#metals-windowstatedidchange).

## Metals is now a default server in the Sublime LSP package

Metals is now a default server for Scala source files in the LSP package, see
[tomv564/LSP#571](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/pull/571). This greatly
simplifies the installation steps for Sublime Text users.
