We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.7.1 - codename "Thorium" 🎉
The release includes several new features along with bug fixes.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
along with contributors from the community.

In this release we merged 21 PRs and closed 8 issues, full details:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/11?closed=1

## TL;DR

- New tree view in VS Code
- New support for Scala 2.13
- New support for JDK 11
- New improved classpath indexing performance
- New fallback to "find references" when calling "goto definition" on a symbol
  definition
- Bug fixes for importing builds in Gradle, Mill and sbt
- Dropped support for deprecated Scala versions 2.11.9, 2.11.10, 2.11.11,
  2.12.4, 2.12.5 and 2.12.6.

Check out the website and give Metals a try: https://scalameta.org/metals/

## Tree views in VS Code

There is now a new "Metals" sidebar in VS Code that contains three tree views:

- Build: overview of the build state, with buttons to manually trigger build
  import.
- Compile: overview of ongoing compilations, with buttons to manually cascade
  compilation and cancel ongoing compilation.
- Help and feedback: buttons to automate troubleshooting Metals issues and links
  to relevant online resources such as GitHub, Gitter and Twitter.

### Reveal active file in Metals side bar

There is a new command "Reveal active file in Metals side bar" that focuses the
library and project explorer to the current open file.

### Compilation explorer

Get an overview of all compilations that are ongoing in the build. Previously,
only a single compilation progress was reported through the status bar.

## Support for Scala 2.13

Metals now supports Scala 2.13.0! Note that functionality may not still work
perfectly in 2.13, in particular:

- code formatting 2.13-specific syntax with Scalafmt such as underscore
  separators (`1_000_000`), we are blocked by a new release including
  [scalameta/scalafmt#1441](https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt/pull/1441).
- whitebox string interpolator macros, we had to disable one unit test for 2.13.
- better-monadic-for compile plugin, we had to disable one unit test for 2.13.

Big thanks to [@gabro](https://github.com/gabro) for leading this effort!

## JDK 11 support

Metals can now run on Java 11! To use Java 11 instead of Java 8, point the
`$JAVA_HOME` environment variable to a Java 11 installation.

The VS Code extension will continue to use Java 8 by default, update the "Java
Home" setting to use Java 11 instead.

To obtain the Java 11 home on macOS, use the following command:

```sh
$ /usr/libexec/java_home 11
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Big thanks to [@er1c](https://github.com/er1c) for pushing for the effort on
both the Bloop and Metals side to support Java 11!

## Improved classpath indexing performance

Previously, to support fuzzy symbol search Metals indexed classpath elements
using an algorithm that required a quadratic iteration on the number of
characters in classfile names. Now, the fuzzy symbol search algorithm only
requires a linear pass on the characters of a classfile name. This optimization
resulted in a 2x speedup for indexing a 235Mb classpath in our benchmarks.

```diff
  Benchmark                   Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units
- ClasspathIndexingBench.run    ss   10  1809.068 ± 61.461  ms/op # JDK 8
+ ClasspathIndexingBench.run    ss   10  919.237  ± 42.827  ms/op # JDK 8
+ ClasspathIndexingBench.run    ss   10  1316.451 ± 22.595  ms/op # JDK 11
```

## Fallback to "find references" from "goto definition"

Previously, nothing happened when invoking "goto definition" on the symbol
definition itself. Now, Metals falls back to "find references" in this
situation.

Big thanks to [@tanishiking](https://github.com/tanishiking) for contributing
this new feature!

## Dropping older Scala versions

The Scala versions supported by Metals are now the following.

| Version | Old Status  | New Status                                                     |
| :------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.11.9  | Deprecated  | Dropped                                                        |
| 2.11.10 | Deprecated  | Dropped                                                        |
| 2.11.11 | Deprecated  | Dropped                                                        |
| 2.11.12 | Supported   | Deprecated, with no plans to be dropped in upcoming releases\* |
| 2.12.4  | Deprecated  | Dropped                                                        |
| 2.12.5  | Deprecated  | Dropped                                                        |
| 2.12.6  | Deprecated  | Dropped                                                        |
| 2.12.7  | Supported   | Deprecated, please upgrade to 2.12.8                           |
| 2.12.8  | Supported   | Supported                                                      |
| 2.13.0  | Unsupported | Supported                                                      |

\* Scala 2.11 support will likely stay around for a while given the situation
with Spark, Scala Native, Playframework and other libraries and frameworks that
have been late to adopt 2.12. Our download numbers show that ~10% of Metals
users are still on 2.11. Nevertheless, we encourage our users to upgrade to 2.12
to enjoy a better code editing experience thanks to multiple improvements in the
compiler.

## Fixes for auto importing builds

- digest only `.sbt` files at workspace level for sbt projects (thanks
  [@wojciechUrbanski](https://github.com/wojciechUrbanski)!)
- fix SemanticDB plugin path on Windows for Gradle workspaces
- update default Mill version to 0.4.1 to fix an issue with classpath not
  containing Scala library
- Metals now pick up the version from `.mill-version` for the `millw` script

## No more "work in progress"

Previously, the Metals website used the "Work-in-progress language server for
Scala" tagline to reflect the experimental status of the project. Now, the
tagline on the website has been changed to "Scala language server with rich IDE
features" to reflect that Metals is used by thousands of developers today for
their day-to-day coding.

## Miscellaneous fixes

- fix off-by-one for parameter hints when the cursor was after the closing `)`
  parenthesis
- make sure we add an autoimport in the correct line in case of brackets
- document symbol outline no longer fails when `val _ = ()` is the only thing in
  a block expression
- nested objects are now imported correctly in case of deeper nesting
- fix concurrent modification in text document cache (thanks
  [@chikei](https://github.com/chikei)!)
