Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Scala 2.12.15 and 3.1.0-RC2 support.
- Indent on paste improvements.
- Show TASTy command.

## Indent on paste improvements

In Metals 0.10.6 we introduced a new feature that would adjust the indentation
of any pasted snippet. You can read about it in
[previous release notes](/blog/2021/09/06/tungsten#automatically-adjust-indentation-on-paste).

The feature was not fully mature and despite our best intentions it could cause
a lot of issues for the users. To help with that we introduced two changes.

Firstly, we will now use the current indentation of the cursor and adjust any
pasted snippet to use that level of indentation.

For example in case of a simple snippet like:

```scala
def hello() =
    println("Hello!")
```

if we paste it into:

```scala
def main() =
  println("Main")
  |
```

after pasting we will have:

```scala
def main =
  println("Main")
  def hello() =
    println("Hello!")
```

However, if we move the cursor back:

```scala
def main() =
  println("Main")
|
```

the result will be different:

```scala
def main =
  println("Main")
def hello() =
  println("Hello!")
```

You can use it to paste anything at the indentation level you need.

Moreover, we also added a new setting `metals.enableIndentOnPaste`, which you
can use to turn the feature on and off. Currently, it's **off** by default. We
highly recommend turning it on, testing out some more and reporting any new
issues.

We also included a number of fixes for indentation in the Visual Studio Code
extension, which should fix some problems in the Scala 3 optional braces code.

## Show TASTy command

What is TASTy? According to the
[official Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/tasty-overview.html):

_TASTy is an acronym that comes from the term Typed Abstract Syntax Trees. It's
a high-level interchange format for Scala 3, and in this document we'll refer to
it as Tasty. Tasty files are generated by the scalac compiler, and contain all
of the information about your source code, including the syntactic structure of
your program, and complete information about types, positions, and even
documentation._

Thanks to [kpodsiad](https://github.com/kpodsiad), Metals can now show TASTy of
a currently opened file using the new `metals.show-tasty` command. However, keep
in mind that currently, this feature works only for Scala 3 sources. You can use
this new command already in nvim-metals and Visual Studio Code.
