smaller improvements.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Scala 0.26.0 and 0.27.0-RC1 support.
- Analyze stacktrace command
- Customizable package exclusions

## Analyze stacktrace command

Thanks to [kpbochenek](https://github.com/kpbochenek), Metals can now help with
navigating stack traces using the new `metals.analyze-stacktrace` command. The
only thing it needs is the actual stack trace string to be input as a parameter
to the command. This new functionality works differently in various editors.

### Visual Studio Code

The only thing users need to do is copy the stack trace and run the
`Analyze Stacktrace` command from the command palette. This will display a new
web view, where it will be possible for users to navigate the files that are
included in the exception.

### coc-metals

With `coc-metals`, you just need to copy the stacktrace, whether from sbt,
bloop-cli, or somewhere else into your register. Once you have it copied, you
can just execute the `metals.analyze-stacktrace`command. This will create
a`.metals/stracktrace.scala` file which can be used to navigate through your
stacktrace using code lenses. Keep in mind that you'll want to make sure you
have codeLens.enable set to true in your configuration. Also, since this feature
relies on code lenses (virtual text in Nvim), it's only supported in Nvim.

### Other editors

To make it work with any other editors users need to run the command manually
with the stacktrace as input, similar to the example above with `coc-metals`.
The command will generate a new file, `.metals/stacktrace.scala`, which can be
used to navigate through the stacktrace using code lenses.

## Customizable package exclusions

Usually, a number of packages are almost never used by the developers and could
clutter the language server output while being of little benefit to the users.
Metals would exclude those packages from indexing causing them to not be
recommended for completions, symbol searches, and code actions. Previously that
list was set in stone and consisted of a number of prefixes:

```scala
val defaultExclusions: List[String] = List(
    "META-INF/", "images/", "toolbarButtonGraphics/", "jdk/", "sun/", "javax/",
    "oracle/", "java/awt/desktop/", "org/jcp/", "org/omg/", "org/graalvm/",
    "com/oracle/", "com/sun/", "com/apple/", "apple/"
  )
```

This list might work in most cases, but users might also want to customize the
list according to their preferences and domain they are working on. Starting
with this release it is now possible to define additional exclusions as well as
remove some from the default list. This can be done via an additional Metals
user setting:

```json
"metals.excluded-packages" : [
  "akka.actor.typed.javadsl", "--javax"
]
```

`--` should only be used to remove some of the defaults if they aren't needed
for your project. Thanks to [ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01) for
contributing this feature!

## Miscellaneous

Some of the smaller improvements to Metals include:

- New recommended Maven Scala template.
- Fix go to source and auto imports in standalone worksheet files.
- Fix missing classes from \_empty package in tree view.
- Add a command to quickly create a new worksheet with a default name.

Beside all the core work on the server itself, there have also been a lot of
great work done in various other Scalameta projects, which Metals relies on.
These projects include [mdoc](http://github.com/scalameta/mdoc), which powers
worksheets and [Scalameta](http://github.com/scalameta/scalameta), which powers
all SemanticDB and parsing powered features. Those contributions helped to
unlock and improve Dotty support in Metals. So special thanks to those projects
and contributors.
