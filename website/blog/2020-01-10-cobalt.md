Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
along with contributors from the community. Recently, Metals has also gained
support from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) with the contributions from
[@ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01). We are extremely grateful for the
growing support from the community and businesses alike, which shows in the
number of new contributions and their quality.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/) and
give Metals a try!

- run and debug for tests and main methods
- go to implementations
- rename symbol
- first code action - import missing symbol
- worksheet support
- improvements for Bloop integration
- better support for Vim via coc-metals
- completion to add all abstract members
- scaladoc auto completion on type `/**`

## Debugging

It is now possible to run and test directly from VS Code using the new "Run",
"Test", "Debug" and "Debug test" buttons. The debug buttons support debugging
with breakpoints. It's possible to insert breakpoints in Java and Scala sources
for both workspace sources as well as library dependency sources.

![debug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3709537/70703645-d0cb9680-1cd0-11ea-9034-a2ef18ffb588.gif)

To support other editors please take a look into the documentation on the Metals
website.

Known breakpoints limitations we are working on:

- debugging is only supported in VS Code at this moment, we hope to increase the
  editor support in the future. To support debugging, editors need to implement
  the
  [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)
- breakpoints may not work as expected in all source locations (example: inner
  classes, ambiguous names, lambdas). Please share your feedback by reporting
  issues!

## Navigation

### Go to implementations

Metals now implements the textDocument/implementations LSP endpoint, which
enables all supported editors to display a list of all implementations of
abstract classes or members.

![implementations](https://i.imgur.com/rke6iny.gif)

Finding implementations also works for symbols outside of the workspace, at the
price of a small performance penalty for the first invocation.

The work done for this feature was also instrumental for implementing the Rename
refactor (see below).

## Refactor

Refactoring support is one of the most requested features in Metals. In this
release, we started by implementing the most commonly used refactors: rename and
import missing symbol.

We plan to add more common refactors along the way. Make sure to check out the
[ones that have already been proposed](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/issues/707)
and consider suggesting other refactors that are essential in your development
workflow.

### Rename symbol

Thanks to the implementation of the `Go to implementations` feature, we were
able to work on a proper rename for any workspace symbol that will rename all
occurrences of a symbol even if that symbol is a part of a class hierarchy.

![rename](https://i.imgur.com/QHaJCr0.gif)

There are a couple of cases in which rename might behave differently based on
the particular symbol being renamed:

- renaming an overriden symbol will rename all occurrences for both parent and
  all children overriding that symbol
- java symbols are not renamed
- renaming "hashCode", "unapply", "unary\_!", "!" is not supported, since they
  change the semantics
- methods starting with `:` can only be renamed to ones with the same first
  character to make sure code compiles afterwards
- renaming apply will change all occurrences with just `()` to a full name
  `.newname()`
- if renaming a class with the same name as the file, the file's name will also
  be renamed
- companion objects will also be renamed along with their companion classes

### Import missing symbol

Another refactor that is commonly requested is the ability to fix a compilation
error by auto-importing a symbol present on the classpath.

This was previously possible in Metals only during completions, but we were
lacking what LSP calls a code action.

Code actions are context-sensitive actions that are proposed to the user in
order to fix an error or to perform a relevant refactor.

Thanks to the work of [@gabro](https://github.com/gabro) we now have a basic
architecture in place for supporting code actions and we were able to implement
this feature.

![missing-symbol](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/691940/68937367-8839bf80-079c-11ea-8401-4927f6531d24.gif)

## Worksheet support

Thanks to great work by [@olafurpg](https://github.com/olafurpg) and some
additional refinements by
[@alekseiAlefirov](https://github.com/alekseiAlefirov), worksheets are now
available in all supported editors.

Worksheets are a way to evaluate code in real time to test and prototype any new
features in a simple way. To create a worksheet all that is needed is to create
a file with the extension `.worksheet.sc` within the source directory of your
workspace (like `/src/main/scala`) and Metals will take care of the rest.

There are two ways worksheets are implemented for different editors. One is with
an additional extension to LSP called `Decoration extension` and it's used by
Visual Studio Code and coc-metals.

Visual Studio Code:

![worksheet](https://i.imgur.com/8c1NkIx.gif)

The other way worksheets are implemented for all other editors that don't
support the `Decoration extension` is using workspace/applyEdits and comments
with hover for larger results.

Sublime:

![worksheet2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10850363/70265661-29fc6d00-179b-11ea-842e-935045e27f96.gif)

## Build tools

In order to make the integration between Bloop and Metals a smoother experience,
several new improvements are included in this release. There're based on
feedback from users as well us our own experiences while working with Metals and
should make the overall experience of importing the build and compiling much
better.

### SemanticDB is resolved inside Bloop

Metals requires the SemanticDB compiler plugin for a number of features to
function properly. Because of that it was quite difficult to add it
automatically in all supported build tools even if those supported Bloop itself.
Perfect examples are Seed and Fury, which use Bloop to compile code, however
adding a plugin automatically would require changes to their core code.

Currently, thanks to
[recent changes](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/942), Metals can send
information about the SemanticDB version, which Bloop uses to automatically
download and configure the SemanticDB scalac plugin. Thanks to that no changes
in the build tool itself are needed. Particular changes in regards to build
tools are:

- Gradle - predef script code used in automatic import is now simplified a lot
  and works with even more customized workspaces. The only thing it needs to do
  is add the Bloop plugin and run `bloopInstall`, which can easily also be done
  manually by the user.
- Maven - no manual configuration is now needed. To import automatically just
  the plugin is needed to be invoked with a setting for downloading sources.
- Sbt - the `metals-sbt` plugin is now removed and the Bloop plugin is now added
  via automatically generated `./project/metals.sbt` file and ran when imported
  automatically. Thanks to this solution it should be possible to reuse Metals
  compilation in the upcoming feature for offloading compilation in Sbt.
- Mill - logic for adding semanticDB plugin is removed from Mill.
- Fury, Seed - no changes were needed for the semanticDB integration and should
  work out of the box.

### Switch to to using Bloop Launcher

Instead of using internal Metals logic, we now use the Bloop Launcher, which
enables us to either connect to an existing Bsp server or start a new Bloop
instance with the specified version if none is running. This greatly simplified
the connection to Bloop and enabled us to work on further improvements.

### Restart Bloop automatically if newer version is needed

Whenever Metals is started and connects to the Bloop build server it receives
information about the version it is running. We compare that version to the one
needed by Metals to make sure everything is properly working. If the current
running version is older we offer to automatically restart it with the newer
version. However, this may not work if Bloop was installed manually.

### Automatically reconnect to Bsp/Bloop if connection is broken

There were numerous issues reported that the connection to Bps or Bloop was
being lost, which causes Metals to behave erratically due to no compilation
being run. To solve this, we now detect if the connection is closed and offer
the user the option of automatic reconnection. This works both when the build
server was down and when the connection was just interrupted. It should also
solve the issues on MacOs with dropped connection.

## Completions

### Completion to add all abstract members

In the past when you were implementing an abstract member in a concrete class,
you'd see the completion option to override the member. However, if you wanted
to implement all of the abstract members, you'd need to do each one
individually. Now you'll see a new completion option in the scenario to
Implement all members which will implement all the members at once.

![implement-all](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d698c2adb18a420fcb4259e4264b6417a5e4bb54/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f617942614344552e676966)

### Support scaladoc auto completion on type `/**`

Thanks to recent work by [tanishiking](https://github.com/tanishiking) Metals
now supports auto completing scaladoc for method definition and class definition
on typing `/**`. More details about it can be found in
[the pull request](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/1250).

![scaladoc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9353584/72444047-ae0e2f80-37f2-11ea-97b0-c5afac035340.gif)

## Better support for Vim via coc-metals

In order to better support the Vim experience with Metals, coc-metals extension
was created which is an extension for coc.nvim, the most popular LSP client for
Vim and Neovim. With this new extension comes a whole bunch of new features for
Metals + Vim users.

- automated installation
- easier configuration options
- easier workspace commands
- embedded doctor
- input box support
- implementation of the decoration protocol (Neovim only)

![coc-metals](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0f56f5a3a874e7c69eff3aaeb2dfe47dc586e3d3/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7a6f66753456492e706e67)

## Support for java 11

Thanks to [@isomarcte](https://github.com/isomarcte) we now also run all tests
on JDK 11, which enables us to be more confident about the support for it. With
some additional changes to the documentation we now can fully claim that support
for JDK 11 is available.

## Other changes

This version includes approximately 25% of the Metals git commit log, which
makes it impossible to explain every possible improvement in these release
notes. Some other features and fixes that we should mention are:

- fix for handling abstract var overrides
- add an empty line after the package declaration before import
- sort auto-completed exhaustive matches by declaration order
- encode the workspace path directory in build digests
- tone down "No SemanticDB" warning
- send Tree View update notification on first no-op compilation.
- enable `goToDefinition` when cursor is at end of symbol
- prioritize build targets with supported Scala versions.
- add automatic formatting of multi-line `stripMargin` strings on paste
- remove support for 2.12.7

## Contributors

Big thanks to everybody who contributed to this release!

We had a lot of new contributors that provided us with some amazing new features
and with some amazing quality.
