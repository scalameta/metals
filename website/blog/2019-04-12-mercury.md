We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.5, codename "Mercury" ðŸŽ‰
This release introduces new features, performance improvements and bug fixes
with highlights including:

- code completions
- parameter hints
- show type at point
- code folding
- document highlight

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) along with contributors from the
community.

In this milestone we merged 76 PRs and closed 26 issues, full details:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/4?closed=1.

## Code completions

It's now possible to use code completions to explore APIs, implement interfaces,
generate exhaustive pattern matches and more.

![2019-04-12 14 19 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/56036958-725bac00-5d2e-11e9-9cf7-46249125494a.gif)

- **Auto-import**: symbols that are not in scope are automatically imported
  locally. Imports still need to be organized manually, we are exploring ways to
  automate this workflow in the future.
- **Override def**: implement methods from the super class.
- **Exhaustive match**: generate an exhaustive pattern match for sealed types.
- **String interpolator**: automatically convert string literals into string
  interpolators.
- **Filename**: complete classnames based on the enclosing file.
- **Documentation**: read the docstring for method symbols by pressing
  ctrl+space in VS Code.

## Hover (aka. type at point)

It's now possible to see the expression type and symbol signature under the
cursor.

- **Expression type**: shows the non-generic type of the highlighted expression.
- **Symbol signature**: shows the generic signature of symbol under the cursor
  along with its docstring, if available.

## Signature help (aka. parameter hints)

It's now possible to view a method signature and overloads as you fill in
arguments.

## Code folding

It's now possible to fold ranges such as large expressions, import groups and
comments.

Big thanks to [@marek1840](https://github.com/marek1840) for contributing this
feature!

## Document highlight

It's now possible to highlight references to the same symbol in the open file.

feature!

## Faster and more relevant fuzzy symbol search

Previously, fuzzy symbol search (`workspace/symbol` in LSP) always returned
results from both the workspace and library dependencies. Now, fuzzy symbol
search returns only results from the workspace unless the query contains a
semicolon character `;`. For example:

- query "Future": workspace only, with fallback to library dependencies if
  workspace contains 0 results
- queries "Future;" or ";Future" or "Fut;ure": workspace + library dependencies.

![](https://i.imgur.com/w5yrK1w.gif)

This change improves the quality for the search results since most often you
want to navigate to symbols defined in the workspace. A nice side-effect is that
workspace-only searches are faster because we avoid redundant work by not
looking at library dependencies.

In addition, this release introduces a new in-memory index for workspace-only
symbol queries resulting in even better performance compared to the last
release.

## Goto definition for in-memory edits

Previously, goto definition worked only for identifiers that had been saved and
successfully compiled in the build tool. Now, you can use goto definition for
symbols that you just typed even if the source file hasn't been saved or
contains type errors.

## Standalone Scala files outside a build tool

Previously, semantic features like goto definition worked only for sources that
belong to a build project. Now, Metals provides completions, parameter hints,
hover and definition for local symbols in standalone Scala files. The classpath
for standalone Scala files includes the JDK and the Scala standard library so
features like completion will not understand symbols from external library
dependencies.

**Known limitation**: only syntax errors are published for standalone Scala
files, the file must belong to a build in order to see type errors.

## New collaboration with VirtusLab

As part of a new collaboration between [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com/) and
the Scala Center, [Marek Å»arnowski (@marek1840)](https://github.com/marek1840)
and [Tomasz Godzik (@tgodzik)](https://github.com/tgodzik) will be contributing
to Metals development for the coming months. They have already contributed
several impressive pull requests:

- `textDocument/foldingRange`
  [(#632)](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/632): code folding that
  understands Scala syntax.
- `textDocument/documentHighlight`
  [(#621)](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/621): highlight occurrences
  of a symbol in the current file.
- `textDocument/completion`
  [(#640)](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/640): override def
  completions from without the need to type "override def ".

It is our pleasure to welcome them to the team and we look forward to working
together with them to improve the Scala editing experience :)

## Contributors
