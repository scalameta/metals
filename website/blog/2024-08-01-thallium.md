title: Metals v1.3.5 - Thallium
---

Metals v1.3.5 is a bugfix release and it's main purpose is to disable best
effort compilation for the time being.

This version also removed support for some of Scala 2.12 and 2.13 versions. We
will keep releasing Metals for the last 4 versions in the 2.12.x and 2.13.x
lines. This means that older versions will not keep getting bugfixes or new
features, which are version specific, but Metals will keep working for them.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Zed,
Helix and Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## Disable best effort compilation

Some users when testing the newest RC of Scala 3.5.0, which supports best effort
compilation, reported that Metals show some errors in the code, which is not the
case for Scala 3.4.x or when using sbt.

This will be most likely fixed later on, but for now, we decided to disable best
effort by default. If you want to still test it out you need to start Metals
with `-Dmetals.enable-best-effort=true` or put that into
`metals.serverProperties` in case of VS Code.
