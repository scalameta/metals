title: Metals v0.7.2 - Thorium
---

We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.7.2 - codename "Thorium" ðŸŽ‰
The release includes mostly bug fixes with some smaller new features. We are
skipping over 0.7.1 due to a critical bug we discovered

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
along with contributors from the community.

In this release we merged 39 PRs and closed 11 issues, full details:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/14?closed=1

## TL;DR

Check out the website and give Metals a try: https://scalameta.org/metals/

- support for Scala 2.12.9
- fix completions in case of inline comments
- add support for non-directory sources
- automatically add package definition to new source files
- automatically insert pipes in multiline string
- a lot of miscellaneous fixes

## Fix completions in case of inline comments

Previously, completions after a comment and newline would yield no results:

```scala
val List(1,2,3)
  .map(num => num + 1) // comment
  @@
```

This was fixed by the Metals team in the presentation compiler itself for 2.12.9
and 2.13.1, however we also added a workaround for all supported older Scala
versions.

## Add support for non-directory sources

In case that your build tool supports having single files as sources, we now
offer full support for them. That corresponds to the most recent BSP
specification
[request](https://github.com/scalacenter/bsp/blob/master/docs/bsp.md#build-target-sources-request)

## Automatically add package definition to new source files

For every new Scala file we automatically add package definition based on the
relative path between the new source file and source root. This is done using
applyWorkspaceEdit method, which causes the change to be done in editor and this
can easily be rewerted like any other change you would type.

We also added support for package objects. Whenever you create `package.scala`
file, we will automatically create the barebone definition of the package
object.

There is still some work to be done about moving files between packages, which
will be addressed in the next release.

Big thanks to the first time contributor from VirtusLab Tomasz Dudzik for
implementing most of the functionality! ðŸŽ‰

## Automatically insert pipes in multiline string

We finally managed to properly support adding `|` in multiline strings using the
`onTypeFormatting` method. Previous implementation was very naive and often
added pipes in wrong places.

To enable the functionality you need to enable `onTypeFormatting` inside your
editor if it's not enabled by default.

In Visual Studio Code this needs to be done in settings by checking
`Editor: Format On Type`:

You will also need the newest version of the Visual Studio Code plugin.

There is still some possible improvements in case of copy pasting entire text
fragments, but that needs some more work.

Big thanks to another of our first time contributors from VirtusLab Karolina
Bogacka! Great work! ðŸŽ‰

## Add support for Scala 2.12.9

Metals now supports Scala 2.12.9! No new Scala version has been deprecated in
this release, since it is possible that Scala 2.12.10 version with some
important fixes will be released soon.

Big thanks to [@gabro](https://github.com/gabro) for again leading the effort!
This took considerably more time and effort than expected.

## Miscellaneous fixes

- erroneous warning for Scala 2.11 is no longer displayed
- don't infer build target for non-readonly files
- fix several small issues in the tree view protocol spec
- set h2.bindAddress to avoid exposing open ports (thanks @blast-hardcheese!)
- resolve symlinks that are used within workspaces
- fix issues when import was requested multiple times without any change
- detect openjdk as a valid jdk home
- warn when java sources were not found
- string interpolation completions now work properly in multiline string
- add ReloadDoctor to the list of all commands (thanks @kurnevsky!)
- add correct mill version in the predef script when running `bloopInstall`
- SemanticDB plugin issues are no longer reported in java only projects
- check if SeamnticDB really exists and only report issue when it doesn't
- update default scalafmt to 2.0.1
- use recommended version for build tools in UI message
- fix file leak when importing large Gradle workspaces
