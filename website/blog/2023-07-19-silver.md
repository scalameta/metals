title: Metals v1.0.0 - Silver
---

We're happy to announce the release of of Metals v1.0.0, which was a long time
in the making. This release is a culmination of a lot of work from the community
and the core Metals team. As it stands, Metals supports most of the important
LSP features and beyond, which makes it equivalent to many IDEs, but in your
favorite editor.

Bringing in version 1.0.0 doesn't mean that we don't have anything else to
improve, but it means that we are confident that Metals is ready for production
use in business and personal projects. We will continue to improve Metals and
add new features, but we will also fully focus on making Metals the most
productive and stable environment for all Scala developers. For that goal we are
providing a number of reporting improvements that can help identify any problems
you might have. There are more of these type of features coming your way.

Note for plugin authors: Starting from this release, any changes in minor
version will mean that there are changes to the Metals behavior or json APIs
that need to be accounted for.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs and
Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/)
and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com) with the help from
[Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- [Better support for Scala CLI](#better-support-for-scala-cli)
- [Support new Scala versions](#support-new-scala-versions)
- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)

## Add multi-root projects support

Up until this release, Metals could only be used in workspaces with a single
root. This means that if for example you used the `Add folder to Workspace`
option in Visual Studio Code to add a new folder to your workspace, Metals would
not work in that folder. This is no longer the case and Metals will work in all
folders in your workspace.

The work included making sure that all existing features work reliably and
sensibly within multi root workspaces. For instance users will properly be shown
a single Metals doctor (or a single HTTP server for editors that do not support
the doctor interface). Test explorer will also show all tests from all folders
clearly marked with the folder name. Most other commands will be invoked in the
currently active folder in order not to create large cascading computations such
as multiple folders compiling everything.

This tremendously useful improvement was authored by
[kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek). Take a look at the
[blogpost](https://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2023/07/17/workspace-folders) for
more details!

## Hover support in Java files

Another improvement for a better experience in Java files was contributed by
[VankaTaganai](https://github.com/VankaTaganai). Starting from this release you
will be able to hover on names in Java files to see more information about them.
This feature is primarily aimed at Scala developers that need to from time to
time look into Java source and figure out what's going on there. This will not
provide an experience of a full Java language server, but it will provide some
basic functionality that will make it easier to work with Java sources.

![java-hover](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2023-07-19-silver/mp1BKse.gif?raw=true)

Please let us know about any issues! This is a new feature and we expect that it
might take some time to get it ironed out.

## Command for running specified scalafix rules

Users will now be able to run a single Scalafix rule on a file in their project.
This might be particularly useful if you don't want to run everything at once
and see exactly what is being done by each Scalafix rule.

This great usability improvement was done by
[LaurenceWarne](https://github.com/LaurenceWarne).

## Add clean-all command

This new feature has been demanded by users for a long while. Thanks to work
done by [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk), you will be able to run the
`metals.reset-workspace` command to remove all the possible caches and
compilation artifacts that might be causing issues in your workspace.

This should be seen as a last resort and used in as an alternative to the
somewhat popular practice of blowing away your `.metals/` and `.bloop/`
directories. Please do keep in mind that if you're finding that you need this
often, it's probably a bug and should be reported.

## Better support for Scala CLI

With Scala CLI becoming the official runner for Scala 3, we have been working on
improving the support for it in Metals. This release brings a number of
improvements that aim to improve both Scala CLI experience and the overall Scala
experience.

This includes the following:

- If there are no build tools present Metals will now fallback to Scala CLI,
  which means that even if a user creates a single file they will be able to run
  it and get all the proper support users would expect. If a build tool
  configuration appears in the workspace, Metals will suggest switching to that
  instead.
- Scala CLI gets the same status as the already supported build tools, which
  means that we will not automatically suggest importing another build tool if
  we have Scala CLI already configured.
- If `project.scala` is present in the workspace, Metals will suggest importing
  Scala CLI project, which includes automatically using the `setupIde` command
  to setup the .bsp configuration.

This splendid work was done by [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek)

## Support new Scala versions

### Support for Scala 3.3.0

For more information about the release take a look at
[https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2023/05/30/scala-3.3.0-released.html](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2023/05/30/scala-3.3.0-released.html)

Here we only show a short summary of the main feature from the release notes.

#### Linting

Scala 3.3.0 brings back linting to the Scala compiler. Right now, you can enable
checking for unused symbols and discarded values. More linting options will come
soon in the following Scala 3.3.x releases.

#### Fewer braces

Braces around method parameters can now be replaced with a colon. This can lead
to cleaner, shorter, and often more readable code in places like configuration
DSLs or test case definitions.

#### Boundary and break

Two new methods were added to the standard library: boundary and break. They are
safer and more expressive replacements for non-local returns, which were
deprecated recently.

break allows for a type-safe early escape from anywhere inside the block
delimited by boundary to its end, returning the passed value from the entire
block.

#### The new default implementation of lazy vals

Last but not least, we have changed the default implementation of lazy vals. The
new implementation has better performance and is safer under parallel access.
This may result in improvements in the performance of effect systems.

### Support for Scala 2.12.18

This release improves compatibility by adding support for JDK 20 and 21 with ASM
9.5 upgrade.

It also aids migration to Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 with improvements for the
-Xsource flag.

For more information about the release take a look at
[https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.18](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.18)

### Support for Scala 2.13.11

Similar to Scala 2.12.18 this release improves compatibility by adding support
for JDK 20 and 21 with ASM 9.5 upgrade.

It also aids migration to Scala 3 with improvements for the -Xsource flag with
even more warnings. For more information about the release take a look at
[https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.11](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.11)
