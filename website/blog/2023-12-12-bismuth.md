We're happy to announce the release of Metals v1.2.0, which continues to improve
reporting mechanisms and reached full feature parity between Scala 2 and 3. This
means that most new releases will focus on stability instead of adding new
features, unless those features contribute to making Metals more reliable.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs and
Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/)
and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com) with the help from contributors from the
community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## Use presentation compiler for synthetic decorations

Up until this release Metals would use the semanticdb information for displaying
synthetic decorations such as inferred types or implicit conversions. This was
not ideal as it meant that the information was not always up to date and could
be inconsistent with the current state of code.

![synthetics](https://i.imgur.com/td11vRH.gif)

To fix that [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk) switched to using the
presentation compiler for this information. This means that each time code
changes the decorations will be refreshed. This also added a number of new
decorations that were not previously available for Scala 3 and it will be on par
with the Scala 2 ones.

This also makes the decorations show proper names in case of name conflicts. So
for example if you have two classes with the same name within a single scope,
they will have a proper prefix shown to help differentiate it.

## Base Metals view on indexing information

Metals tree view enables users to navigate their workspace in a more structured
way by directly showing the build modules and their packages, classes, objects
etc. It would also allow users to navigate their dependency jars. Previously,
this was based on special Scala 2 signature information, which means it wouldn't
work in Scala 3.

From this release we changed it to use the same information that is used for
indexing in case of jars and semanticdb for local workspace files. This means
that Scala 3 is fully supported and this has been the last big feature missing
for full parity between Scala 2 and 3.

![tree-view](https://i.imgur.com/Vun4kJh.gif)

All the existing features should now work for Scala 3 as well. This includes the
reveal command which allows to quickly reveal the current file in the tree view
including inside jars.

![tree-view-reveal](https://i.imgur.com/xW0W3I3.gif) Additionally, we improved
icons used by the tree view. They will now use the default VS Code icons for the
most part, which should make them more consistent with the rest of the editor.

## Go to definition for scaladoc

When writing scaladoc for your methods or classes you can use links, which are
of a form `[[name.name.ClassName]]`. Thanks to
[kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) Metals will now allow you to
navigate to the target of the link via normal go to definition.

![scaladoc-def](https://i.imgur.com/TYNMCEm.gif)

To learn more about linking in scaladoc check out the
[Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/scaladoc/linking.html)

## Custom project root setting

Metals currently will try to find the proper build tool root for your project,
which is useful especially if you open a parent directory that doesn't contain a
build tool configuration. However, this can be problematic if you have a less
traditional setup and you need to be able to control the root directory. For
example if you have an sbt source dependency and you still want to have that
dependency open in the same window.

To help with that we added a new setting `metals.customProjectRoot` that allows
you to specify the root directory for your project. This setting is available in
the settings UI and can be set to a path relative to the workspace root.

![custom-root](https://i.imgur.com/sgr1j1T.png)

Another amazing feature from [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek)

## Bsp errors in status

In the previous release Metals started showing more errors from the build server
with the intention on making it clearer to the user what is going on. However,
showing a message request for the user could be quite invasive and not always
relevant.

To help with that [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) added a new status
bar item that will show the number of errors in the build server. This will be
shown only if there are any errors and will be hidden once the reports connected
to them are removed.

![bsp-status](https://i.imgur.com/Kdn2347.gif)

## Add back unintentionally removed support for 2.11.x

For the most of the releases Scala 2.11.12 support was not being actively
tested, which led to some of the features not working properly. This release
brings back the support for 2.11.12 and adds a CI job to make sure it is working
properly. The support is still on the best effort basis, so we highly recommend
to migrate to newer versions of Scala, which feature numerous bugfixes and
security fixes.

It's highly possible that we will stop supporting new features for 2.11.x in the
near future, but it seems for the time being there is still a number of
contributors that require it.

## Changes for plugin authors

Tree view icons changed and use a number of default VS Code ones. If previously
icons were show in other editors, this change could cause them to stop being
shown properly. Full list of icon names can be found
[here](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/blob/main/metals/src/main/scala/scala/meta/internal/tvp/ClasspathTreeView.scala#L109).

Another change is the addition of the custom project root setting
`metals.customProjectRoot`, which should be accounted for in the user facing
editor interface.
