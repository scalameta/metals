title: Metals v1.3.0 - Thallium
---

We're happy to announce the release of Metals v1.3.0, which brings several big
features and multiple bugfixes. One of the main things to take a look at is the
Java home changes, let us know if it caused any issues for you! Another big
change is the improved debugger, which is a fruit of a lot of hard work. As
always we are striving to improve our stability, so if you notice an issues or
any errors popping up in .metals/.reports do let us know!

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs and
Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/)
and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com) with the help from contributors from the
community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## New Scala versions support

Metals now supports `2.12.19`, `2.13.13` and `3.3.3` Scala versions. That
support was also back-ported to the previous Metals v1.2.2.

Starting with 3.3.5 version all newer Scala releases will not require specific
support in Metals thanks to additional inclusions of presentation compiler
module within the compiler.

## Java Home improvements

Starting with this version of Metals, JDK used for running Metals and the one
used for your project can now be separate. This allows us to simplify setting up
JDK for running Metals, which will be automatically downloaded using coursier if
not detected on your machine.

This means we have two settings for Java:

- `metals.javaVersion` - version of Java to be used for running Metal language
  server, used within Visual Studio Code. Users can choose from 11, 17 and 21.
  Java 8 is deprecated and will be dropped with the next release.
- `metals.javaHome` - Java used for your project, Metals will try to add all the
  appropriate flags so that language features are consistent with the version of
  Java you are using. Will always support JDK 8 and higher.

## Automatic imports setting

Thanks to [keirlawson](http://github.com/keirlawson) it's now possible to make
Metals automatically import any workspace. This takes a shape of a new setting
`metals.autoImportBuild` which has three options:

- `off` - users will always be asked whether they want to import their workspace
  either initially or after changes.
- `initial` - when users first open a new workspace Metals will automatically
  import the workspace, but will still ask about reimporting after changes.
- `all` - Metals will always automatically import and reimport your workspace.
  This might make more sense when using other build tools than Bloop as it might
  take a while to run the import.

## Preferred build server setting

Thanks to [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) it's now possible to
default to the BSP server instead of Bloop for all your workspaces using
`metals.defaultBspToBuildTool` setting. This will work with Mill and sbt, which
support both.

## Inlay hints support

After a huge amount of work by [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk) Metals
will now use the standard LSP way of showing decorations via Inlay Hints instead
of a custom solution. Thanks to this, the decorations behave much more naturally
like usual code, you can navigate to definition and get proper hovers. It will
also allow all editors to support decorations without implementing the
additional extension to the protocol.

![inlay-hints](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2024-04-15-thalium/G6H2aPr.gif?raw=true)

Additionally, together with inlay hints we reworked all the decoration settings
to be included in a single object and two new ones were added:

- `metals.inlayHints.typeParameters.enable` - when this option is enabled, each
  place where a type parameter is applied has it displayed either as additional
  decorations if they are supported by the editor or shown in the hover.
- `metals.inlayHints.hintsInPatternMatch.enable` - when this option is enabled,
  each place when a type is inferred in a pattern match has it displayed either
  as additional decorations if they are supported by the editor or shown in the
  hover.

There is a small issue within VS Code, which might be fixed in the future, and
it makes it impossible to hover on multiple parts of a particular type
consecutively. Users have to move the cursor away from the type and again onto
the part of the type they want to learn more about.

Inlay hints will also not work 100% for any older deprecated Scala 2 versions
and Scala 3 versions 3.4.0, 3.4.1, 3.3.0, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3. For those
versions Metals uses a fallback that translates the older decorations to the new
inlay hints, but without go to definition and hover.

## Exhaustive matches for union types

Another great new feature done by [jkciesluk](https://github.com/jkciesluk)
enables users to get a suggestion that will complete a pattern match with all
types within a union type.

![union](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2024-04-15-thalium/yY2TvSk.gif?raw=true)

## Debugger improvements

The Scala debugger adapter library, which is responsible for providing debugging
experience in Metals, has been released recently under v4.0.0 with a lot of
great improvements. These include:

- Pretty stacktraces (Scala 3 Only) - improved stack trace names that are easier
  and more useful to read for the users.

![pretty](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-debug-adapter/assets/13123162/8e0cbfe0-26ea-418e-913c-43400be04d37)

- Runtime evaluator - allows evaluating Java-like expression in Scala and Java
  source files without using the compiler. It is faster, it can access private
  members, and it does not require casting to access members of runtime types.
- Hot-code replace - The hot-code replace feature allows to change the behavior
  of a running program. It is now possible to change the body of a method, and
  to reload it in the debugged program. After the hot-code replacement, any call
  to the modified method will execute the new implementation, even on former
  instances of the changed class. This feature is particularly useful to track a
  bug and fix it in a single debug session.

![hot-code](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-debug-adapter/assets/13123162/f5dbce3a-ca64-484d-a377-e52c091e3f05)

- Collapse skipped frames - the debugger indicated frames which are not useful
  for the users, Metals will now collapse them by default.

![collapse](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/assets/13123162/2923f1e9-3ec6-4240-891b-36593434dc48)

This all was done thanks to the hard work of [adpi2](https://github.com/adpi2),
[iusildra](https://github.com/iusildra) and other contributors.

You can read more on the
[v4.0.0 release page](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-debug-adapter/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

## Go to implementations for dependency sources

Previously, it was only possible to search for implementations inside
dependencies as Metals didn't index type hierarchy. Thanks to
[kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) it's now possible to do that in both
Scala and Java files with an exception of JDK to avoid additional cost of
indexing it in every workspace. The latter will be fixed later on.

![implementations](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2024-04-15-thalium/JarfZHE.gif?raw=true)

As with inlay hints, this feature will not work when using older deprecated
Scala 2 versions and some of the older Scala 3 3.3.x and 3.4.x versions.

## Completions for implicit classes

Another feature implemented by [kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek) is
adding support for completions of old style extension methods that were declared
within implicit classes. This will work similar to extensions method completions
for Scala 3.

![implicit](https://github.com/scalameta/gh-pages-images/blob/master/metals/2024-04-15-thalium/pLt8GF2.gif?raw=true)

## Plugin author changes

Doctor format version changed to 6 due to the
[added project Java information](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/6226).
