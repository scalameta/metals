We are pleased to announce the release of Metals v0.3.2. Metals is a language
server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim, Sublime Text and Emacs.
Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) with
contributors from the community.

## Metals server

Full details: https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/3?closed=1

In this release we closed 7 issues and merged 17 PRs.

### Improved sbt launcher

Metals now respects `.sbtopts` and `.jvmopts` when running `sbt bloopInstall`.
If you need further customization like reading environment variables, then you
can configure the "Sbt Script" setting (`-Dmetals.sbt-script=/path/to/sbt`).

### Build server discovery

Metals now works with any build tool that implements
["BSP Connection Protocol"](https://github.com/scalacenter/bsp/blob/master/docs/bsp.md#bsp-connection-protocol).
See the Metals docs for more information:
https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/new-build-tool.html#custom-build-server

### Blog post on fast goto definition with low memory footprint

New blog post on how Metals implements Goto Definition:

## VS Code

Release notes: https://github.com/scalameta/metals-vscode/releases/tag/v1.1.0

### Improved Java home detection

The extension now automatically detects a Java 8 home directory even if Java 11
is installed on the computer. Also, the extension now works for `jenv` users.

### Outdated server version detection

The extension now automatically detects when you have a custom "Server Version"
setting with an outdated version.

## Sublime Text

The Metals process now exits when Sublime Text quits so that you no longer end
up with zombie `metals-sublime` processes.

[@ayoub-benali](https://github.com/ayoub-benali) has contributed several
improvements to [tomv564/LSP]((https://github.com/tomv564/LSP) to improve the
experience of using Metals with Sublime Text.

Watch the
[scalameta/metals-sublime](https://github.com/scalameta/metals-sublime/)
repository for updates on further improvements to the Sublime Text integration.

## Emacs

The website now documents the installation steps for Emacs:
https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/emacs.html

Note that the Emacs LSP client has several known issues so the experience is not
as good as it could be.
