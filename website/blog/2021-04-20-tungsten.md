Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- [Scala 3] Support for Scala 3.0.0-RC3
- Add code action to add/remove string interpolation.
- Offer to organize imports when on an unused import.
- [Scala 3] Better names for types in completions and hovers.

## Add/remove string interpolation

Thanks to some great work by our newest contributor
[Giggiux](https://github.com/Giggiux) it's now possible to:

- easily add string interpolation to an existing string

```scala
val message = "Hello this is a message"
```

When the cursor is positioned inside of the string we can invoke the code action
and get:

```scala
val message = s"Hello this is a message"
```

While this is a simpler code action, it can be paired with other things like
completions that allow for a workflow with less manual steps.

- remove string interpolation if no splices are found

When the cursor is positioned inside a string interpolation, that does not contain
any splices ( `$identifier`), we will now offer an action to quickly get rid of
the additional `s`.

```scala
val message = s"Hello this is a message without splices"
```

will change to:

```scala
val message = "Hello this is a message without splices"
```

## Offer to organize imports when on an unused import

In addition to the usual "organize imports", to try to improve the user
experience, Metals now offers a code action to organize imports whenever the
cursor is situated on an unused import reported by the diagnostics. Thanks
[ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01) for this new feature!

## [Scala 3] Better names for types in completions and hovers.

Thanks to another great PR by [tanishiking](https://github.com/tanishiking)
Metals will offer completions and hovers that include shorter names instead of
fully qualified ones whenever they are currently in scope. They will also be
more similar to the ones that you might be accustomed to in Scala 2. You can
find some more examples of improvements in the
[pull request](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/2637) itself.

## Miscellaneous

- Make insert type work with renamed imports.
- Treat `.srcjar` as jars to support Bazel in the future (thanks
  [darl](https://github.com/darl)!).

Big thanks to everybody who contributed to this release or reported an issue!
