We're happy to announce the release of Metals v0.9.5, which brings about some of
the long awaited features such as implicit decorations and the organize imports
code action. We also greatly simplified connecting to the sbt BSP server and
added support for Scala 3's first milestone `3.0.0-M1`.

For full details: https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/28?closed=1

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Organize imports code action.
- Show implicit parameters and inferred type decorations.
- Improved sbt BSP support.
- Support for Scala 3.0.0-M1.
- Remote debugging.
- Environment variables in run/debug.

## Organize imports code action

One of the most requested features in the Metals repository, current list can be
found [here](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/issues/707), was the ability to
automatically organize imports. We are happy to announce, that thanks to
[mlachkar's](https://github.com/mlachkar) amazing contributions to both
[Scalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix) and Metals, this new feature
is now available via an `Organize imports` code action.

![imports](https://i.imgur.com/8YBdjjC.gif)

Depending on the editor this code action can be invoked differently, please
consult your specific editor's documentation. For example in Visual Studio Code
'organize imports' can be invoked from command console, shortcut, or from the
dropdown menu when right clicking inside a file.

The organize imports code action is enabled using
[Scalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix) and specifically the awesome
organize imports rule created by [liancheng](https://github.com/liancheng).

The rule can be used to automatically sort imports in a file by the Ascii order,
which is the default setting, or use the user specific configuration defined
using scalafix configuration file. This file can be either `.scalafix.conf` in
the current workspace or an absolute file specified in the
`metals.scalafixConfigPath` user setting. It's important to note that the new
code action is consistent with how sbt's scalafix plugin will behave.

An example scalafix configuration for the organize imports rule can look like
this:

```scala
OrganizeImports {
  groups = ["re:javax?\\.", "scala.", "*"]
  removeUnused = true
}
```

This will sort imports into 3 groups defined with regexes and remove any unused
ones. Specifically, it will turn:

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.{Buffer, ArrayBuffer}
import java.time.Clock
import java.lang.{Long => JLong, Double => JDouble}

object RemoveUnused {
  val buffer: ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer.empty[Int]
  val long: JLong = JLong.parseLong("0")
}
```

into

```scala
import java.lang.{Long => JLong}

import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer

object RemoveUnused {
  val buffer: ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer.empty[Int]
  val long: JLong = JLong.parseLong("0")
}
```

Please do NOT use the Scalafix built-in RemoveUnused.imports together with
OrganizeImports to remove unused imports, since it might result in a broken
code.

More information can be found in the
[liancheng/scalafix-organize-imports](https://github.com/liancheng/scalafix-organize-imports)
repository.

## Show implicits and type decorations

Another highly anticipated feature was the ability to show additional
information about the code, which is not provided explicitly. In this new
release, users can use two new options when looking through their code:

- `metals.showImplicitArguments` will enable users to see implicit parameters
  within their code:

![params](https://i.imgur.com/vAvM7YV.png)

- `metals.showInferredType` will enable users to see inferred type for any
  generic methods they are using:

![types](https://i.imgur.com/K3QrUd2.png)

Both new options are disabled by default, since they add a great number of
information, which might not be necessary for all users. Full name with package
for each of the additional types or values will be available on hover.

These options can be set in Metals options in VS Code or in Emacs
[(lsp-metals)](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-metals) using
`lsp-metals-show-implicit-arguments` and `lsp-metals-show-inferred-type`
variables set to `t`.

Unfortunately, due to current limitations, additional decorations are only
possible in Visual Studio Code and Emacs. In other editors the additional
information is available via hover and new `With synthetics added` section,
which shows how the whole current line would look with the additional
decorations.

Example of how this alternative approach looks in Vim:

![vim-sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13974112/94804295-e094a280-03ea-11eb-8282-2a783446e7c8.png)

## Improved sbt BSP support

In recent months, [eed3si9n](https://github.com/eed3si9n) and
[adpi2](https://github.com/adpi2) worked, under the auspices of Scala Center, on
making sbt capable of acting as a
[Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/) server. This
enables Metals and other editors such as Intellij IDEA to directly communicate
with sbt in order to compile the user's code.

Some more work was required in order to make the new features work smoothly with
Metals and currently, thanks to [ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01), users can
easily try out the new sbt BSP support. It's important to note that using Bloop
instead of sbt is still the recommended approach as we believe it provides the
best user experience and features like running or debugging are still not yet
implemented for sbt. More details and explanations can be found in the
[blogpost](/metals/blog/2020/11/06/sbt-BSP-support).

## Remote debugging

Thanks to the great work of [pvid](https://github.com/pvid), Metals now supports
remote debugging, which means that it can attach to a running process with the
proper JVM options specified. There is no longer a need to run the application
or test from within the editor.

In case of a simple java process those options will take a form of for example:

`-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005`

Some of the more important options here are:

- `suspend=y` will make the process wait for Metals to connect to it if
  specified to `y`. `n` will cause the process to run normally.
- `address=5005` specifies which port to use and it can be any free port.

For a detailed explanation of the different options please refer to the proper
documentation
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/conninv.html)

When using sbt, remote debugging can be achieved by specifying additional
settings:

```scala
  javaOptions in run := List("-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"),
  fork in run := true
```

This will cause running `sbt run` to wait for Metals to connect to it, which
might be especially useful when reading user input, which is currently
impossible to do for example from within VS Code. Similarly, these options can
be specified in any of the supported build tools.

To later connect to the running process, you need to use the additional Attach
request type with the `buildTarget`, `hostname` and `port` fields specified. In
case of Visual Studio Code this will take a form of:

```json
{
  "type": "scala",
  "request": "attach",
  "name": "Attach",
  "buildTarget": "root",
  "hostName": "localhost",
  "port": 5005
}
```

## Environment variables in run/debug

Metals now supports specifying additional environment options when running or
debugging applications. This can be done twofold:

- By specifying the new `env` field:

```json
{
  "type": "scala",
  "name": "Debug Main",
  "request": "launch",
  "mainClass": "Main",
  "args": ["hello", "world"],
  "env": { "VARIABLE1": " 123" }
}
```

- By using the `envFile` field:

```json
{
  "type": "scala",
  "name": "Debug Main",
  "request": "launch",
  "mainClass": "Main",
  "args": ["hello", "world"],
  "envFile": "local.env"
}
```

Where the `local.env` file can take a form of:

```
# single line values
key1=value 1
key2='value 2'   # ignored inline comment
key3="value 3"

# multi-line values
key4='line 1
line 2'
key5="line 1
line 2"

# export statements
export key6=value 6

# comma delimiter
key7:value 6

# keys cannot contain dots or dashes
a.b.key8=value 8   # will be ignored
a-b-key9=value 9   # will be ignored
```

The format is adapted from
[mefellows/sbt-dotenv](https://github.com/mefellows/sbt-dotenv) and
[bkeepers/dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). Example json
configurations above are defined for Visual Studio Code, the `type` and `name`
fields can be omitted when using in other clients.

This new feature has been contributed by [mwz](https://github.com/mwz). Thanks
for the great work!

## Miscellaneous

  configuration.
- Fixed top level completions in empty files.
- Fixed issues with run/debug when using VPN.
- Fixed go to java sources in standalone worksheets.
- Fixed issues with worksheets if the workspace was not first compiled.
- Fixed sbt completions coming from `project/*.scala` files.
- Only use `import {java.util => ju}` when there are conflicting symbols in the
  file.
- Muted InvalidProtocolException in the logs - this exception might happen.
  normally and does not break anything.
- Changed scalafix and scalafmt location in user configuration to absolute path.
- Only report parsing errors after Scala version is confirmed for a file.
