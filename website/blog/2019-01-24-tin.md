We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.4, codename "Tin" ðŸŽ‰ Metals
is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim, Sublime Text
and Emacs. Metals is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/)
with contributors from the community.

## Metals server

In this release we merged 50 PRs and closed 21 issues, full details:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/4?closed=1.

### Upgraded Bloop

This release upgrades from Bloop v1.1.2 to v1.2.5, which includes several
improvements to diagnostics and compilation performance. See release notes for
more details and upgrade guide.

- [v1.2.5](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/tag/v1.2.5)
- [v1.2.4](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/tag/v1.2.4)
- [v1.2.3](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/tag/v1.2.3)
- [v1.2.1](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/tag/v1.2.1)
- [v1.2.0](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Major props to [@jvican](https://github.com/jvican) for his great work on Bloop.
Bloop does the heavy lifting around build import and compilation for Metals.

### Syntax errors as you type

Previously, Metals only published compile errors from the build on file save.
Now, a syntax error is also published as you type making it easier to catch
common errors like unclosed string literals and missing parentheses.

This change has an additional benefit in editors like Vim where compile errors
would previously disappear if you for example inserted a newline above an error.
Now, Metals updates the positions of errors as you type.

### Faster and more reliable clearing of fixed compile errors

A bug where red squiggles for fixed errors would occasionally not be cleared has
now been fixed.

Also red squiggles for fixed errors disappear faster thanks to an improvement in
Bloop. Previously, diagnostics were cleared after the bytecode generation phase
in the compiler and now they are cleared after the typer phase.

### More detailed compilation progress

The status bar now includes information which individual build targets are being
compiled along with a percentage estimate for how much remains of the
compilation.

### Cascade compile command

Use the new "Cascade compile" command to trigger compilation in downstream build
targets in the workspace. For example, if you have made changes in the main
sources of you project you can run cascade compile to trigger compilation in the
test sources.

### Formatting with Scalafmt

It's now possible to format code with
[Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/).

![Formatting with scalafmt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/50635748-b0894880-0f53-11e9-913b-acfd5f505351.gif)

It's possible to use different version of Scalafmt between different workspaces.
To configure which Scalafmt version to use for a given workspace update the
`version` setting in `.scalafmt.conf`.

```conf
# .scalafmt.conf
version = "1.5.1"
```

### Symbol outline

It's now possible to browse the symbol outline of a source file.

![Document Symbols](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/50635569-014c7180-0f53-11e9-8898-62803898781c.gif)

Metals returns a hierarchical outline for editor that support it (like Visual
Studio Code, Atom, Emacs) and otherwise returns a flat outline.

### Find symbol references

It's now possible to look up all usages of a given symbol in the workspace.

![Find symbol references](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/51531254-3a368280-1e3d-11e9-8df2-4560c6294e35.gif)

### Fuzzy symbol search

It's now possible to look up a symbol definition in the workspace or library
dependencies by typing its name. All-lowercase queries are treated as
case-insensitive searches.

![Fuzzy symbol search example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1408093/51537603-44fa1300-1e4f-11e9-84f2-eb7d4c6fc7ef.gif)

This feature is not supported yet in Sublime Text.

### Blog post on low-memory symbol indexing with Bloom filters

Read the post
["Low-memory symbol indexing with bloom filters"](https://olafurpg.github.io/metals/blog/2019/01/22/bloom-filters.html)
to learn how Metals implements indexing for the features "fuzzy symbol search"
and "find symbol references".

## Visual Studio Code

Full changelog:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals-vscode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

### Lower default memory settings

The extension now starts Metals with the JVM option `-Xms100M` instead of
`-Xms1G`. The exact memory usage of Metals depends on the size of the project
and whether Bloop is installed on the computer or not, but only 50-100Mb can be
sufficient memory for Metals in many cases.

### Improved Java home detection

The extension now chooses the latest available JDK home for Java 8. Previously,
the extension sometimes picked the JRE over JDK or an older version of Java 8
when newer security updates were installed on the computer.

### .jvmopts detection

The extension now uses JVM options from `.jvmopts` when launching Metals so it's
possible to configure HTTP proxy settings without custom configuration. Memory
options like `-Xms100M` are ignored in `.jvmopts`, use the "Server Properties"
setting to customize memory settings.

## Vim

It's recommended to update vim-lsc to the latest version, full changelog:
https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

### Update log_level setting

A recent change in how log messages are displayed makes the status bar updates
from Metals disappear unless you set the default `log_level` setting to `Log`.
Update `.vimrc` as follows:

```diff
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
-  \  'scala': 'metals-vim'
+  \  'scala': {
+  \    'command': 'metals-vim',
+  \    'log_level': 'Log'
+  \  }
+  \}
```

### View multi-line error messages

Run the new `:LSClientLineDiagnostics` command to display all diagnostics on the
current line and to un-truncate multi-line error messages. Big thanks to
[@ayoub-benali](https://github.com/ayoub-benali) for contributing several
[improvements to LSP](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aayoub-benali+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

## Sublime Text

It's recommended to upgrade to LSP v0.8.1, full changelogs:

- https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/releases/tag/0.8.1
- https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/releases/tag/0.8.0

### Built-in "import build" dialogue

It's now possible to respond to the "Import build" dialogue from Sublime Text
without using the HTTP server.

### Manual "import build" command

It's now possible to manually trigger a build import from the command palette.

See
[manually trigger build import](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/sublime.html#manually-trigger-build-import)
for instructions how to configure this command.

## Emacs

The
[Emacs installation instructions](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/emacs.html)
have been improved thanks to [@JesusMtnez](https://github.com/JesusMtnez).
