Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- [Scala 3] Scala 3.0.0 support!
- Scala 2.13.6 along with `-Xsource:3` support.
- Extract class code action.
- Rename file as class.
- [Scala 3] Auto imports in completions and code actions.
- Support same names in different build targets.

## Extract class code action

Due to the great work by [@Giggiux](https://github.com/Giggiux) Metals now
provides a new `Extract to file` code action, which is available when there are
multiple definitions in the source file. This works for classes, traits, enums,
and objects. The code action will not show if the definition we are extracting
is or extends a `sealed` definition.

The extraction happens via a code action on the definition's name, it will also
extract any relevant package definition, imports, and, if available, the
companion.

## Rename file as class

It is also now possible when there is only a single definition in a file that
doesn't have the same name as the definition, to quickly rename the file
according to its content.

## [Scala 3] Auto imports in completions and code actions

Previously, the experience of writing Scala 3 code might be spoiled because
these usual features weren't implemented for Scala 3 in Metals. We are happy to
say that there is no more need to write imports by hand and remember the exact
path to the symbol. Now, completions in Scala 3 sources provide symbols from the
workspace and libraries and their application automatically adds the necessary
import. Code action `AutoImport` also started working.

Enjoy writing Scala 3!

This required some huge amounts of effort and is working thanks to
([dos65](https://github.com/dos65)).

### Support same names in different build targets

This change fixes navigation issues that previously happened in case of having
clashing names across libraries and projects. An additional thing you might
notice with this change is the presence of library names in `.metals/readonly`
directory. Previously, for example, if jump into `String` the file was extracted
into `./metals/readonly/scala/Predef.scala`.

Now it will be
`./metals/readonly/dependencies/scala-library-$scalaVersion-sources.jar/scala/Predef.scala`

## Miscellaneous

- Support names with dots for "Implement all members" code action.
- Fix invalid auto imports with wrong prefix.
- Fix flaky "Organize imports" behaviour.

Big thanks to everybody who contributed to this release or reported an issue!
