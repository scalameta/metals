Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Automatically adjust indentation on paste.
- New code actions.
- Allow organize imports on unsaved code.
- [Scala 3] support for Scala 3.0.2 and 3.1.0-RC1.
- JDK 17 support.

## Automatically adjust indentation on paste

Starting with Scala 3 developers can use optional braces, which we mentioned in
some of the previous release notes. One of the main problems with it is making
sure that users are able to properly paste code into existing blocks. Previously
we could just paste into braced blocks and adjusted the indentation later, but
now it really matters that indentation is changed properly in order to make to
code compile correctly.

To help with that [@Giggiux](https://github.com/Giggiux) adjusted the existing
range formatting to account for indentation in the pasted blocks. Starting from
this release Metals will adjust the indentation to match that of the enclosing
block irrelevant of whether it has braces or not. A number of improvements has
also been done to make sure the cursor ends up on the correct indentation level
upon writing a newline.

If you encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to report them since the
functionality is new and there might be some edge cases where it doesn't work.
This was tested internally over the past month, but that doesn't account for all
the different styles of how people write their code. You can turn off on paste
formatting in Visual Studio Code in the settings using the
`editor.formatOnPaste` property. This feature will only work with the editors
that support range formatting.

## New code actions

This release benefits from adding two new code actions. Actions are based on
particular scenarios, where we might automate some mundane coding and their
behaviour is usually clearly specified. Please let us know if there are any
other particular situations, which might be automated, via the the Metals's
[feature requests repository](http://github.com/metals-feature-requests).

### Refactor pattern match with placeholder

Thanks to [kpodsiad](https://github.com/kpodsiad) it's now possible to
automatically rewrite lambdas with `_ match` expressions to partial functions:

![partial-func](https://i.imgur.com/Ffm4RXZ.gif)

### Replace () with {} in functions and vice versa

It's quite often that in Scala we might want to change to a simple lambda to a
multiline one or vice versa. This has previously been a manual chore, but now
whenever possible you can do it via a code action:

## Allow organize imports on unsaved code

In previous version it was only possible to organize imports in files that were
saved and compiled. We're happy to report that this requirement has been lifted
and users can organize imports whenever needed.

## Miscellaneous

- Fix completions for definitions from other files in Ammonite scripts.
- Support for Apple M1 and JDK 17. [@dos65](https://github.com/dos65)
- [Scala 3] Show extension methods in hover.
- Support brackets in multiline strings.
  [@kpodsiad](https://github.com/kpodsiad)
- Automatically convert $ to $$ when changing to string interpolation.
- Filter out wrong reference results from unrelated build targets.
  [@dos65](https://github.com/dos65)
- Greatly improved parent code lenses performance and turned it on by default in
  VS Code. [@tanishiking](https://github.com/tanishiking)
- Properly show folding ranges in Scala 3 indented blocks.
  [@tpasternak](https://github.com/tpasternak)
- Fix comments erasing all later variables in .env file.
- Fix file watcher in large projects on macOS. [@pvid](https://github.com/pvid)
- Fix memory leak issue in Scala 3 projects. [@dos65](https://github.com/dos65)
