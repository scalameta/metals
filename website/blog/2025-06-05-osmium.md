Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Zed,
Helix and Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## MCP improvements and fixes
Based on user feedback since the previous release, we have fixed some issues related to MCP and added some new tools to further facilitate better agent interaction.

New tools:
 - `compile-module` - compile a chosen build target, input is the module name, the same as visible in the Metals Doctor.
 - `find-dep` - completion tool for finding dependencies using Coursier added by [tgodzik](https://github.com/tgodzik).

Improvements:
 - MCP port is now saved and reused for the workspace, so it doesn't have to be repeatedly adjusted in other configurations.
 - Better responses in compile tool. Previously it would only return information about issues and an empty result otherwise; now we explicitly mark a successful compilation. Also for file compilation, if no error is found in the file, Metals will return errors from the whole module to provide possibly useful context.

Fixes:
 - `inspect` for Scala 3 would previously fail and return only the symbol name.
 - `verbose` flag marked as optional was previously required. Thanks, [rtar](https://github.com/rtar) for the fix.
 - Correctly handle package objects.
 - Fix generating MCP configuration for VSCode alternative distributions (VSCodium and insider versions).

## Module status bar
This release includes a new status bar, which should make some information about the module state more visible.

By default, the status shows the name of the module (build target) that the file in focus belongs to. If the file doesn't belong to any build target or due to an error the build target cannot be resolved, the status will show `no build target` error message. If the build target is found but there is a compile error in an upstream module, the status will show an error with the name of the upstream module. Finally, if the build target is found and there are no upstream errors, but there are new error reports created for the build target, the status will show a warning with the number of error reports.

## Fixed blocking user requests
In the previous release, a bug was introduced where Metals would sometimes block waiting for the response for user notification. As a result, `Import build`, `Switch build server` and similar requests would fail to work. This issue was fixed in this release with an added timeout.

## Fixes for backticked identifiers
This release brings a few fixes around handling backticked identifiers: selection range, location of insert-types code action, and symbol search. Thanks go to [harpocrates](https://github.com/harpocrates), who added the needed special handling where it was missed.

## Changes for plugin authors
This release adds a `module` `statusType` to `metals/status` request. Further, it modifies the `MetalsStatusParams` by adding a new `metalsCommand` field with the following scheme
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "command": "string",
  "tooltip": "string | undefined",
  "arguments": "any[] | undefined"
}
```
`metalsCommand` field should take precedence over the previously existing `command` field.

Depending on if the client supports the `metals/status` extension, the field `moduleStatusBarProvider` in initialization options should be populated; it can contain one of the following values:
 - `on` - if client supports `metals/status`
 - `off` - if the client doesn't support `metals/status`
 - `show-message` - if the client doesn't support `metals/status`, but would like the module status to be sent via show message request.
 - `log-message` - if the client doesn't support `metals/status`, but would like the module status logged.
If the field is empty, it defaults to `off`.
