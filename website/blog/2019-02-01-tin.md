title: Metals v0.4.4 - Tin
---

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) along with contributors from the
community.

## Metals server

In this milestone we merged 5 PRs, full details:
https://github.com/scalameta/metals/milestone/5?closed=1.

### Improved code navigation

Several "goto definition" and "find references" bugs have been fixed in this
release. In particular, code navigation should work more reliably now for the
following language features

- for comprehensions with multiple assignments and guards
- eta-expanded methods and functions passed as values
- val patterns like `val (a, b) = ...`
- named arguments in `apply` methods
- repeated parameter types (varargs)

### Empty source directories are no longer created

Previously, Metals created all source directories like `src/main/java` and
`src/main/scala-2.12` even if they were unused. Now, Metals still creates these
directories but removes them again after the file watcher has started. Big
thanks to first-time contributor [@mudsam](https://github.com/mudsam) for
implementing this fix!

### Multiple workspace folders

Metals now looks for `.scalafmt.conf` in all workspace folders instead of only
the workspace root.

### Avoid `metals.sbt` compile errors on old sbt versions

The generated `metals.sbt` file in `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/metals.sbt` now compiles
on all versions of sbt 0.13.x even if Metals itself still only works with sbt
0.13.17+.

## Visual Studio Code

The Metals extension was installed over 1000 times over the past week!

### `JAVA_OPTS`

The Metals extension now respects the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable the same
it does the `.jvmopts` file. For example, set `JAVA_OPTS` to
`-Dhttps.proxyHost=‚Ä¶ -Dhttps.proxyPort=‚Ä¶` to configure HTTP proxies. It's
recommended to start VS Code with the `code` binary from the terminal to ensure
environment variables propagate correctly.

## Sublime Text

There's a WIP pull request
[tom654/LSP#501](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/pull/501) adding support for
fuzzy symbol search (`workspace/symbol`). Please upvote with üëç if you'd like to
use this feature!

## Emacs

There is a new Gitter channel
[rossabaker/lsp-scala](https://gitter.im/rossabaker/lsp-scala) for Emacs and
Metals users.

The `lsp-scala` package is now published to MELPA
[melpa/melpa#5868](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/5868).
