We are excited to announce the release of Metals v0.7.6, which will most likely
be the last release before the v0.8.0 one. This release includes support for new
Scala versions (2.12.10, 2.13.1) and a couple of fixes. It also adds a new
formatting on paste feature for multiline strings.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Atom, Vim,
Sublime Text and Emacs. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
along with contributors from the community.

In this release we merged 11 PRs and closed 5 issues, full details:

## TL;DR

Check out the website and give Metals a try: https://scalameta.org/metals/

- add support for Scala 2.12.10 and 2.13.1
- formatting on paste for multiline strings
- fixes for autofill feature

## Add support for Scala 2.12.10 and 2.13.1

Thanks to @gabro's continuing effort we were able to add support for both new
Scala versions. Those versions fix a couple of important regressions and are now
available to use with Metals!

## Formatting on paste for multiline strings

Whenever text is pasted into a multiline string with `|` it will be properly
formatted by Metals:

To enable this feature you need to enable formatting on paste in your editor of
choice. In Visual Studio Code it can be done via modifying a checkbox:

## Fixes for autofill feature

After releasing the experimental autofill feature we addressed feedback by:

- not filling in the default arguments
- adding `???` as a first option when alternative values are available to avoid
  mistakes
- add subtypes as valid values
- only show autofill option when using named parameters or by explicitly typing
  `autofill...`

Let us know if you have any further feedback!
