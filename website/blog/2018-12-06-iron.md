## Simple installation

A useful IDE needs to understand your project's directory structure and library
dependencies. Metals can now import sbt and Bloop builds with the following
workflow

- Open a directory in your editor
- Click on a button to import the build
- Wait for the build import step to complete, this may take a while
- Enjoy IDE features ðŸ‘Œ
- When your build changes, Metals asks you to import again.

## Accurate diagnostics

Once your build has been imported, Metals triggers compilation on file save and
publishes compiler errors as red squiggles in your editor. By construction, this
approach avoids the situation where users see different errors in their editor
and the build tool.

## Goto definition

Metals supports goto definition for project sources and Scala+Java library
dependencies. Navigation works even when the open buffer contains syntax errors.

Navigation in Metals is fast and consumes little memory. For a case study
project, Metals indexes 800k lines of Scala code per second and the resulting
search index requires 25Mb RAM per million lines of code.

## Text editors

Thanks to the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/),
Metals works multiple text editors. The following editors have been validated to
work with Metals and the installation steps have been documented on the Metals
website.

## Contributors

Big thanks to all the contributors who contributed to this release. In
particular, I want to thank the following people:

- Jorge Vicente Cantero (@jvican) for his great work in Bloop and helping out
  with unblocking a lot of Metals issues on the build side. Most the heavy
  lifting in "simple installation" is provided by Bloop.
- Gabriele Petronella (@gabro) for his great work on the VS Code plugin and
  heroic code reviews of multiple large PRs (of which one that was +12,645
  âˆ’1,126!!).
- Alexey Alekhin (@laughedelic) for his great work on the Atom `ide-scala`
  package.
- Eugene Burmako (@xeno-by) for close collaboration on Scalameta and SemanticDB
  that made the features in this release possible.
- Justin Kaeser (@jastice) from Jetbrains for collaboration on the Build Server
  Protocol specification and bsp4j library.
