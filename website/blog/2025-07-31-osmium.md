Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Zed,
Helix and Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## SQL highlighting

Thanks to [Mensh1kov](https://github.com/Mensh1kov) Metals now supports highlighting SQL queries in the editor when `sql` or `fr` interpolated strings are used.

## Model Context Protocol Improvements

The biggest number of improvements in this release are related to MCP support. This includes both new features and overall quality of life improvements.

### New features

This release includes two new tools. The first one is a tool to list currently available modules, which helps agents to discover what modules are available to use ([kasiaMarek](https://github.com/kasiaMarek)). The second one is a tool to format files, which helps agents to format files in a way that is consistent with the project's style ([ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01)).

### Quality of life improvements

Based on feedback from the community, a few quality of life improvements have been added to the MCP tools.

First of all, support for ZIO to the MCP test tool has been added by [avshRepo](https://github.com/avshRepo). This allows LLM Agents to run specific tests in ZIO test support. Another improvement in this area is the ability to run specific tests cases added by [ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01).

Another improvement is related to configuring the MCP server. We now save the MCP server configuration in the workspace settings, so that it's available to all tools that use MCP. This might be useful when connecting to MCP for example multiple LLM tools to use the same port without having to manually configure it.

Moreover, there have been some race conditions when starting Metals in Cursor when the MCP server was not yet ready. We now recreate the MCP server configuration after we are sure that the server is started.

Lastly, this release added support for claude by default again thanks to [ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01).

For all of you asking to use Metals MCP standalone, there has been some community contributions to make it easier to use Metals MCP standalone. Checkout [metals-standalone-client](https://github.com/jpablo/metals-standalone-client) by [jpablo](https://github.com/jpablo) for more details.

## Updates to fuzzy matcher logic

There has been a number of reports by users that the previous behaviour of fuzzy matching is too strict and caused some completions to be hidden when the case of the first letter is wrong. This has been fixed by [ltrojanowski](https://github.com/ltrojanowski) and the new behaviour is now more forgiving.

You can take a look at the [details](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/pull/7570) for more information as well as provide us some further feedback.

## New X-ray inlay hints

Thanks to [henryxparker](https://github.com/henryxparker) Metals now supports so called X-ray inlay hints that you might know from IntelliJ. When those inlay hints are enabled you will see the type next to a longer chain of expressions. This is particularly useful when you are working with complex expressions and you want to understand exactly what transformations are taking place.

```scala
val transformedList =
   List(1, 2, 3)
     .map(x => x * 2)/*     : List[Int]*/
     .map(x => x.toString)/*: List[String]*/
     .map(x => x.length)/*  : List[Int]*/
```

Try it out by enabling the `metals.inlayHints.hintsXRayMode` setting. Let us know what you think!

The feature is currently available only for Scala 2, we will add support for Scala 3 in the near future, but it requires a new version of the Scala 3 compiler.
