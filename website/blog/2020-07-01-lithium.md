We're happy to announce the release of Metals v0.9.1, which focused on fixing
issues with the recently released Scala 3 support, Ammonite support and a couple
of new features.

Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs,
Sublime Text, Atom and Eclipse. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from
the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

- Ammonite support
- New project provider
- Worksheet dependency support
- Multiline string improvements
- Scala versions 2.13.3, 0.24.0, 0.25.0-RC2 support
- Dropped support for Scala 0.23.0 and deprecated the 0.24.0-RC1 version.
- Multiple build tool selection within a workspace

## Ammonite support

Thanks to great work by [alexarchambault](https://github.com/alexarchambault) we
now support [Ammonite](https://ammonite.io) script files. Ammonite enables you
to create scripts that can easily be ran from the command line, without the
overhead of setting up a build tool while still allowing you to download and use
dependencies.

The support includes most of the LSP features such as diagnostics, completions,
references, go to definition, but does not include running or debugging the
scripts. This new feature works by starting an additional Ammonite BSP server
that compiles the scripts and provides additional information about them such as
Scala version or information about the added dependencies. You can change the
default JVM parameters for the server such as `-Xmx`, which will limit the used
memory in Metals settings. These can be added via your metals editor extension
using the newly created `metals.ammoniteJvmProperties` setting. The Ammonite
server can also be started and stopped manually using the new commands
`ammonite-start` and `ammonite-stop`.

Each of the scripts first need to be imported into the Ammonite BSP server,
which can be done manually by clicking on the pop up whenever a new script is
opened or selecting automatic import at the start, which will import any open
scripts automatically.

It's important to note that this is an early approach to Ammonite support, which
might still require some improvements both on the Metals and Ammonite side. You
can learn more about the new feature or join the discussion in the
[blogpost](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/ammonite-support-in-metals/4306)
on the Scala contributors forum.

Some of the notable features of Ammonite scripts are:

- Import other scripts: Metals provides completions to select existing files
  based on the filesystem information

```scala
//main.sc
import $file.hello-world
val greeting = hello-world.greeting

//hello-world.sc
val greeting = "Hello world!"
```

- Import dependencies:

```scala
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::scalatags:0.7.0`
import scalatags.Text.all._

val rendered = div("Moo").render
```

- Set Scala version:

```scala
// scala $scalaVersion

import scala.util.Properties

pprint.log(Properties.releaseVersion)
```

The Scala version is independent from any build tool used in the workspace and
without specifying the exact version it will use the default Ammonite Scala
version.

To learn more about Ammonite please visit the documentation website at
[https://ammonite.io](https://ammonite.io).

## Worksheet dependency support

In addition to Ammonite support, which will be useful to anyone interested in
Scala scripting, we've also improved the support for Metals Scala worksheets.
Thanks to the efforts of [olafurpg](https://github.com/olafurpg) in
[mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/), which powers worksheets, users are now able
to import dependencies directly inside of their Scala worksheet with completions
and diagnostics working right from the start.

![worksheet-imports](https://i.imgur.com/qXgdNWM.gif)

You can add them using the following syntax:

```
$ivy.`organisation::artifact:version`
```

For example:

```
$ivy.`com.lihaoyi::scalatags:0.9.0`
```

`::` is the same as `%%` in sbt, which will append the current Scala binary
version to the artifact name.

## New project provider

Creating new Scala projects is usually a bit of work to get started, which is a
problem for both beginners and experts alike. Normally you don't want to spend a
lot of time figuring out the best setup for starting with a new technology or
the language itself.

There are great tools like [giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/), which
is used in the `sbt new` command, that enables people to use already existing
Scala templates found on Github such as
[https://github.com/scala/scala-seed.g8](https://github.com/scala/scala-seed.g8).
The problem is when you don't use sbt or you don't know the exact template you
want to use.

To address this, we've added an additional command called `New Scala Project`
that enables users to reuse the same mechanism from the comfort of your editor.
Firstly, you can choose from existing templates, either curated by the Metals
team, ones existing on the giter8
[wiki page](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/wiki/giter8-templates) or
alternatively an entirely custom template. Then you can choose the exact
location for the new project and the name. Afterwards, Metals will run giter8 to
create the project and offer to open that new project.

![new-project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3807253/81842954-2d1b3680-954d-11ea-934a-96fe53cafeb9.gif)

The command is also available as a button in the welcome view of the Visual
Studio Code Metals extension, which means it will be visible in case there are
no imported projects in the current workspace.

The first curated templates were chosen by the team, however we are happy to
include more so that it's easier for people to discover new amazing libraries or
frameworks.

## Multiline string improvements

There are two new quality of life improvements when it comes to multiline
strings. Firstly, thanks to [mlachkar](https://github.com/mlachkar) we now
automatically add `stripMargin` method invocation when using newline in a
multiline string if that string uses `|` and has no existing `stripMargin`:

![strip-margin](https://i.imgur.com/Z2Q1glN.gif)

This behaviour can be disabled in Metals settings using
`metals.enableStripMarginOnTypeFormatting`.

Another useful improvement coming from [colineto](https://github.com/colineto)
is a new code action that can easily convert single string into the traditional
multiline string with `|` and `stripMargin` at the end:

![new-action](https://i.imgur.com/5ohRcl9.gif)

## Multiple workspace build tools selection

Previously, Metals would only pick up a single build tool in a workspace even if
in reality there were multiple available ones. To help with that we added a
prompt to choose the desired build tool in workspaces with multiple build files.

An example situation where this is needed is when you have a project with both a
`build.sbt` and `build.sc`, but the `build.sc` is what you use for your build
definition. Previously if both were detected, it was automatically considered an
Sbt workspace, however now it's possible to choose.

![multiple-build-tool](https://i.imgur.com/pAgZK7u.gif)

In case of multiple build tools in single workspace you can see which one was
used to import project in 'Metals Doctor' view. If you choose the wrong one, or
change the main build tool later on, you'll need to remove the .metals/
directory to reset the decisions.

This great new feature was contributed by [ckipp01](https://github.com/ckipp01)!

## Miscellaneous improvements

- Fix run/debug in Maven workspaces.
- Always run newest sbt version if none is specified.
- Fix find references for Scala 3 on Windows.
- Pick jvm targets with higher priority when using run/debug without specifying
  the exact build target.
- Make breakpoints work properly in Scala 3 and in case of nested classes.
- Exhaustive pattern matching in the case of sealed upper bound types.
- Compile before renaming instead of showing an error.
- Fix issue with symlinked source directories.
- Fix missing references for synthetic companion objects.
- Automatically add -J if it doesn't already exist to java properties when
  running or debugging.
- Fix go to definition for JDK 11 library sources.
- Keep modifiers when implementing abstract members.
- Fix auto imports position when using package objects and multiple package
  definitions.
- Fix issues in files with Scala 2.13 specific syntax like for example
  underscore numeric literals (`val num = 100_000`).
- Always run Mill in interactive mode.
- Improvements to hover in Scala 3 files.
- Make sure auto imports are correct for Ammonite scripts
