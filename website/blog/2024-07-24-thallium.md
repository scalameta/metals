Metals is a language server for Scala that works with VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Zed,
Helix and Sublime Text. Metals is developed at the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
with the help from contributors from the community.

## TL;DR

Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and
give Metals a try!

## Scala 3 best effort compilation

Starting with this release Metals will take advantage of Scala 3 best effort
compilation. This should greatly improve the IDE experience of working with
non-compiling code. With best effort compilation Scala 3 compiler will produce a
tasty-like format files that can also include partially broken trees even when a
module does not compile. Those files, similarly to normal tasty files, will be
later consumed by the presentation compiler providing most up to date
information about the project. This great feature has been delivered by
[jchyb](https://github.com/jchyb) and will be available starting with Scala
`3.5.0`.

## Sort workspace members with the same name by frequency

Workspace member completions with the same name are now sorted by their usage
frequency, so the symbols more often referenced in project appear higher on the
list of completions. This cool feature was added by
[Temurlock](https://github.com/Temurlock).
