title: The Development of Metals
---

Metals is a open-source project that drew inspiration from various places
including previous LSP servers, other ecosystems, and fresh ideas of the time.
Metals has also been graciously given developer time and focus from
organizations like [The Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) where the project
originated and also companies like [Virtus Lab](https://virtuslab.com/) that now
lead the effort in the development and maintenance of the project.

## Previous LSP work

Huge thanks to [`@dragos`](https://github.com/dragos) for his work on a Scala
implementation of the LSP (see: https://github.com/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala).
This project helped us get quickly started with LSP. Since then, we have
refactored the project's original sources to the point where only a few simple
case classes remain.
