## Acknowledgement

Huge thanks to [`@dragos`](https://github.com/dragos) for his work on a Scala
implementation of the LSP (see: https://github.com/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala).
This project helped us get quickly started with LSP. Since then, we have
refactored the project's original sources to the point where only a few simple
case classes remain.

## Why Metals?
