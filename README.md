This project is an experiment to implement a
[Language Server](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) for
Scala using [Scalameta](http://scalameta.org/) projects such as
[Scalafmt](http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/),
[Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) and
[SemanticDB](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/blob/master/semanticdb/semanticdb3/semanticdb3.md).

## Acknowledgement

Huge thanks to [`@dragos`](https://github.com/dragos) for his work on a Scala
implementation of the LSP (see: https://github.com/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala).
This project helped us get quickly started with LSP. Since then, we have
refactored the project's original sources to the point where only a few simple
case classes remain.

## Alternatives

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html):
  the most widely used IDE for Scala using a re-implementation of the Scala
  typechecker.
* [ENSIME](http://ensime.org): brings Scala and Java IDE-like features to
  editors like Emacs and Sublime Text using the Scala Presentation Compiler.
* [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/): Eclipse-based IDE using the Scala
  Presentation Compiler.

## Why Metals?

Metals = Meta (from Scalameta) + LS (from Language Server)
