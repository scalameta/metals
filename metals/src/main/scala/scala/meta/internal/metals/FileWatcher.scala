/**
 * Handles file watching of interesting files in this build.
 *
 * Tries to minimize file events by dynamically watching only relevant directories for
 * the structure of the build. We don't use the LSP dynamic file watcher capability because
 *
 * 1. the glob syntax is not defined in the LSP spec making it difficult to deliver a
 *    consistent file watching experience with all editor clients on all operating systems.
 * 2. we may have a lot of file watching events and it's presumably less overhead to
 *    get the notifications directly from the OS instead of through the editor via LSP.
 *
 * Given we rely on file watching for critical functionality like Goto Definition and it's
 * really difficult to reproduce/investigate file watching issues, I think it's best to
 * have a single file watching solution that we have control over.
 *
 * This class does not watch for changes in `*.sbt` files in the workspace directory and
 * in the `project/`. Those notifications are nice-to-have, but not critical. The library we are
 * using https://github.com/gmethvin/directory-watcher only supports recursive directory meaning
 * we would have to watch the workspace directory, resulting in a LOT of redundant file events.
 * Editors are free to send `workspace/didChangedWatchedFiles` notifications for these directories.
