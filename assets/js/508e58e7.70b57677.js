Once it's started, even if you close Metals, it\ndoesn't shut down. So let's say you start Metals and no Bloop is running. Metals\nwill then start Bloop with the current version that Metals knows about. For\nexample, let's say it starts 1.4.4. Later that day a new version of Metals comes\nout that uses Bloop 1.4.5. When you update, Metals detects that 1.4.4 is\nrunning, and then you see the prompt in the image saying that it needs a newer\nversion. Probably to either include a bug fix from Bloop, a new feature, etc.\nWhy doesn't Metals just shut down Bloop and restart automatically? That's a\ngreat question, and one that we're exploring.
