        |###  Assertions
        | A set of `assert` functions are provided for use as a way to document
        | and dynamically check invariants in code. Invocations of `assert` can be elided
        | at compile time by providing the command line option `-Xdisable-assertions`,
        | which raises `-Xelide-below` above `elidable.ASSERTION`, to the `scalac` command.
        |
        | Variants of `assert` intended for use with static analysis tools are also
        | provided: `assume`, `require` and `ensuring`. `require` and `ensuring` are
        | intended for use as a means of design-by-contract style specification
        | of pre- and post-conditions on functions, with the intention that these
        | specifications could be consumed by a static analysis tool. For instance,

        |  require(nats forall (_ >= 0), "List contains negative numbers")
        |  nats.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)
        |} ensuring(_ >= 0)
        |```
        | The declaration of `addNaturals` states that the list of integers passed should
        | only contain natural numbers (i.e. non-negative), and that the result returned
        | will also be natural. `require` is distinct from `assert` in that if the
        | condition fails, then the caller of the function is to blame rather than a
        | logical error having been made within `addNaturals` itself. `ensuring` is a
        | form of `assert` that declares the guarantee the function is providing with
        | regards to its return value.
        |

        | are provided for the "widening" of numeric values, for instance, converting a

       |- Only the first dimension of an array may have a size < WIDTH
