# Architecture of Metals

This document describes the high-level architecture of Metals following the philosophy of [rust-analyzer's ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html)

- For LSP specification, please refer [the LSP document](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), you don't have to read all of the `specification`, just read the `overview` and pick out the interesting parts when you need it.

## LSP endpoints

The most important file of this project is `MetalsLanguageServer.scala`. In this file, we define all of the LSP endpoints, for example, you will find the endpoint for `textDocument/completion` request as follows.

```scala
@JsonRequest("textDocument/completion")
def completion(...) = ...
```

In addition to the LSP endpoints, this file contains many components, for example `private var semanticdbs: Semanticdbs = _`. Those components will be initialized later at some points like on LSP's `initialize` request.

## Presentation compiler

Metals features are powered by presentation compilers, if you hit `Compilers.scala` it is the client of compilers.

`mtags` module is the Scala version specific module used to interact with the Scala presentation compiler. You can find the Java interfaces under `mtags-interface` project.

For example, `ScalaPresentationCompiler.java` in `mtags-interface` is the interface for `ScalaPresentationCompiler.scala` under `scala-2` and `scala-3` directories of `mtags` module.

  - Scala2: `interactive/Global.scala` in [scala/scala](https://github.com/scala/scala)

## SemanticDB

Metals uses [semanticdb](https://scalameta.org/docs/semanticdb/guide.html) for many features (Providers that receive the instance of `Semanticdbs`). Metals consumes SemanticDBs in two ways:

- `FileSystemsSemanticdbs` consumes SemanticDBs on disks
  - Semanticdb will be generated by the build servers to disk, see https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/integrations/new-build-tool#enable-semanticdb
- `InteractiveSemanticdbs` will generate SemanticDB on the fly using the presentation compiler via `mtags`, in case `FileSystemsSemanticdbs` failed or when the build tool doesn't compiler specific files such as dependency sources or sbt files.

In addition, classes extend `SemanticdbFeatureProvider` index the semanticdb symbols, that will be updated by `SemanticdbIndexer`.

## Build Server

Metals communicates with build server such as `bloop` and `sbt` using [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/).

`BspConnector.scala` manages the connections between Metals and build server, and `BuildServerConnection.scala` represents the API wrapper for the build server.

For more details about sbt's BSP support in Metals, see [the blog post](https://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2020/11/06/sbt-BSP-support/).

## Worksheet

TBD

## Formatting

`FormattingProvider.scala` takes care of how Metals handles `textDocument/formatting`. It uses [scalafmt](https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt) as a code formatter downloading dynamically using `scalafmt-dynamic`.
We don't embed a specific version of scalafmt into Metals so that users can switch scalafmt's version using `.scalafmt.conf`.

Note that `FormattingProvider` doesn't handle `textDocument/rangeFormatting`.

## Scalafix
