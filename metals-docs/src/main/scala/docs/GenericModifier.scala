       |## Files and Directories to include in your Gitignore
       |
       |The Metals server places logs and other files in the `.metals` directory. The
       |Bloop compile server places logs and compilation artifacts in the `.bloop`
       |directory. The Bloop plugin that generates Bloop configuration is added in the 
       |`metals.sbt` file, which is added at `project/metals.sbt` as well as further 
       |`project` directories depending on how deep `*.sbt` files need to be supported. 
       |To support each `*.sbt` file Metals needs to create an additional file at 
       |`./project/project/metals.sbt` relative to the sbt file.
       |Working with Scala CLI scripts will place compiled scripts into the `.scala-build` directory.
       |It's recommended to exclude these directories and files
       |from version control systems like git.
